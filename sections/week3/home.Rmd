### Part 1: Mediation {.unnumbered}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r include = FALSE}
library(haven)
library(lavaan)
library(dplyr)

seData <- read_sav(paste0(dataDir, "SelfEsteem.sav"))
```

In this practical, we will analyze the data contained in *SelfEsteem.sav*. These
data comprise 143 observations of the following variables.^[These data were
simulated from the covariance matrix provided in Laible, D. J., Carlo, G., & Roesch, S. C. (2004). Pathways to self-esteem in late adolescence: The role of parent and peer attachment, empathy, and social behaviours. Journal of adolescence, 27(6), 703-716.] 

- *case*: Participant ID number
- *ParAtt*: Parental Attachment
- *PeerAtt*: Peer Attachment
- *Emp*: Empathy
- *ProSoc*: Prosocial behavior
- *Aggr*: Aggression
- *SelfEst*: Self-esteem

Load the *SelfEsteem.sav* data.

*Note*: Unless otherwise specified, all following analyses apply to these data.

Suppose we are interested in the (indirect) effects of peer attachment on self-
esteem, and whether empathy has a mediating effect on this relationship.

We might generate the following hypotheses:

  1. Better peer relationships promote higher self esteem
  1. This effect is mediated by a student's empathy levels, where better peer
  relationships increase empathy, and higher levels of empathy lead to higher
  self-esteem.
  
---

To evaluate these hypotheses, we will use **lavaan** to estimate a path model.

---

###

  - Draw a path model (on paper) that can be used to test this hypothesis
  - Label the input (X), outcome (Y) and mediator/intermediary (M)
  - Label the paths a, b, and c'
  
*Hint*: Refer back to the [Mediation Basics](#mediation-basics) lecture if you need help here.

```{r echo=FALSE}
mod <- '
## Equation for outcome:
SelfEst ~ Emp + PeerAtt

## Equation for stage 1 mediator:
Emp ~ PeerAtt
'

library(tidySEM)
fit <- sem(data = seData, model = mod)
fit %>% 
  prepare_graph(
    layout = get_layout(
      NA, "Emp", NA,
      "PeerAtt", NA, "SelfEst", rows = 2
    ),
    angle = 60
  ) %>% 
  edit_edges({
    label <- c('b', 'c\'', "a", NA, NA, NA)
  }) %>%
  edit_nodes({
    label <- c("M: Emp", "X: PeerAtt", "Y: SelfEst")
  }) %>% 
  plot()
```
</details>

---

### {#w3syntax}

Specify the lavaan model syntax implied by the path diagram shown above.

- Save the resulting character string as an object in your environment.

*Hint*: Refer back to the example in which opinions on systematic racism mediate
the relationship between political affiliation and support for affirmative
action policies from the [Mediation Testing](#mediation-testing) lecture this week.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
mod <- '
## Equation for outcome:
SelfEst ~ Emp + PeerAtt

## Equation for the mediator:
Emp ~ PeerAtt
'
```

</details>

---

### {#fit1}

Use the `lavaan::sem()` function to estimate the model defined in \@ref(w3syntax).

- Use the default settings in `sem()`.


<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
library(lavaan)
out <- sem(mod, data = seData)
```

</details>

---

###

Explore the summary of the fitted model.

  - Which numbers correspond to the a, b, and c' paths?
  - Interpret these paths in terms of regression coefficients
  - Do the direction of the effects seem to align with our hypothesis?
  
<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
summary(out)
```
  
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
    
```{r, include=FALSE}
tmp <- parameterestimates(out)

peer_c   <- tmp %>% filter(lhs == "SelfEst", op == "~", rhs == "PeerAtt")
emp_b   <- tmp %>% filter(lhs == "SelfEst", op == "~", rhs == "Emp")
peer_a <- tmp %>% filter(lhs == "Emp", op == "~", rhs == "PeerAtt")

```

  The results show our regression paths for the a path (`Emp` ~ `PeerAtt`), the
  b path (`SelfEst` ~ `Emp`), and the c' path (`SelfEst` ~ `PeerAtt`).

  All three of the effects in the model, including the direct effect of
  `PeerAtt` on `SelfEst`
  ($\beta = `r peer_c$est %>% round(3)`$,
  $Z = `r peer_c$z %>% round(2)`$,
  $p = `r (peer_c$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$),
  and the parts of the indirect effect made up by the effect of `PeerAtt` on
  `Emp`
  ($\beta = `r peer_a$est %>% round(3)`$,
  $Z = `r peer_a$z %>% round(2)`$,
  $p = `r (peer_a$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$),
  and `Emp` on `SelfEst`
  ($\beta = `r emp_b$est %>% round(3)`$,
  $Z = `r emp_b$z %>% round(2)`$,
  $p = `r (emp_b$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$) are all positive and significant.

  We can see that the direction of the effects seems to be supportive of our
  hypotheses, but without taking the next steps to investigate the indirect
  effect, we should be hesitant to say more. 
  
  </details>
  
</details>
---

Remember that an indirect effect (IE) is the product of multiple regression 
slopes. Therefore, to estimate an IE, we must define these products in our 
model syntax. In **lavaan**, we define the new IE parameters in two steps. 

1. Label the relevant regression paths.
1. Use the labels to define new parameters that represent the desired IEs.

We can define new parameters in lavaan model syntax via the `:=` operator. The 
**lavaan** website contains a tutorial on this procedure: <http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/mediation.html>

---

###

Use the procedure described above to modify the model syntax from \@ref(w3syntax) 
by adding the definition of the hypothesized IE from `PeerAtt` to `SelfEst`.

*Tip* You can use any labeling scheme that makes sense to you, but I recommend
  adopting some kind of systematic rule. Here, I will label the individual
  estimates in terms of the short variable names used in the path diagram above. 

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
mod <- '
## Equation for outcome:
SelfEst ~ y_m1 * Emp + PeerAtt

## Equation for mediator:
Emp ~ m1_x1 * PeerAtt

## Indirect effect:
ie_PeerAtt := m1_x1 * y_m1
'
  
```
  
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
    
  Notice that I only label the parameters that I will use to define the IEs. You 
  are free to label any parameter that you like, but I choose the to label only 
  the minimally sufficient set to avoid cluttering the code/output.
  
  </details>

</details>

---

### {#test1}

Use `lavaan::sem()` to estimate the model with the IEs defined.

- Use the default settings for `sem()`.
- Are the hypothesized IEs significant according to the default tests?

*Hint* Refer to the [Mediation Testing](#mediation-testing) lecture 

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
out <- sem(mod, data = seData)
summary(out)
```
  
  <details>
    <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
    
```{r, include = FALSE}
tmp <- parameterestimates(out)

pa <- tmp %>% filter(label == "ie_PeerAtt")
```

  The IE of *Peer Attachment* on *Self Esteem* through *Empathy* is significant ($\hat{\textit{IE}} = `r pa$est %>% round(3)`$, 
  $Z = `r pa$z %>% round(2)`$, $p = `r (pa$p / 2) %>% round(3)`$).
  
  (Remember that we specificed a one-sided hypothesis test!)

  
  </details>

</details>

---

Remember that the default significance test for the indirect effect here is
still the same as the Sobel Z approach. To have an appropriate, robust test of
the significance of the indirect effect requires bootstrapping, which we will
do later this week in the in-class assignments. 

---

###

Let's add another variable to our model: *parental attachment*

Our research question now will be whether attachment, both to parents and to
peers, influences a student's self esteem. Secondarily, we would like to know
if someone's empathy influences the relationship. 

- Specify the lavaan model syntax implied by this research question
- Estimate the model using `lavaan::sem()`
- Investigate the model summary

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
mod2 <- '
## Equation for outcome:
SelfEst ~ Emp + ParAtt + PeerAtt

## Equation for mediator:
Emp ~ ParAtt + PeerAtt

## Covariances:
ParAtt ~~ PeerAtt
'

out <- sem(mod2, data = seData)
summary(out)
```
  
</details>


---

###

Now add labels to the model to allow for testing of the the indirect effect of
*PeerAtt* on *SelfEst* and *ParAtt* on *SelfEst* and estimate the model again.

<details>
  <summary>Click to show code</summary>
  
```{r}
mod3 <- '
## Equation for outcome:
SelfEst ~ y_m1 * Emp + ParAtt + PeerAtt

## Equation for mediator:
Emp ~ m1_x1 * ParAtt + m1_x2 * PeerAtt

## Covariances:
ParAtt ~~ PeerAtt

ie_ParAtt  := m1_x1 * y_m1
ie_PeerAtt := m1_x2 * y_m1
'

out <- sem(mod3, data = seData)
summary(out)
```
  
</details>

---

###

What can we say about the two indirect effects? Can we say that empathy mediates
both paths? Why or why not?

### Part 2: Moderation {.unnumbered}


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember that moderation attempts to describe *when* one variable influences
another. For the home exercise, we'll go back to the Sesame Street data we
worked with for the in-class exercises last week, only this time, we will add in
a categorical variable that we will be our moderator. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### {.unnumbered}

Load the `Sesam2.sav` data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Read the data into an object called 'sesam2':
sesam2 <- read_sav("Sesam2.sav")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sesam2 <- read_sav(paste0(dataDir, "Sesam2.sav"))
```

### 

*VIEWCAT* is a nominal grouping variable, but it is represented as a numeric
variable in the `sesam2` data. The levels represent the following frequencies of
Sesame Street viewership of the children in the data:

1.    Rarely/never
1.    2-3 times a week
1.    4-5 times a week
1.    \> 5 times a week

-   Convert *VIEWCAT* into a factor.
-   Make sure that `VIEWCAT = 1` is the reference group.

*Hints:*

-   You can identify the reference group with the `levels()` or `contrasts()`
    functions.
-   The reference group is the group labelled with the first level printed by
    `levels()`.
-   When you run `contrasts()`, you will see a pattern matrix that defines a
    certain dummy coding scheme. The reference group is the group that has zeros
    in each column of this matrix.
-   If you need to change the reference group, you can use the `relevel()`
    function.

<details>

<summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
# library(forcats)
## Convert 'VIEWCAT' to a factor:
sesam2 <-
  sesam2 %>%
  mutate(VIEWCAT = factor(VIEWCAT))

## Optionally specify the labels
# sesam2 <-
#   sesam2 %>%
#   mutate(VIEWCAT = factor(VIEWCAT,
#                           levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
#                           labels = c("Rarely/never",
#                                      "2-3 times per week",
#                                      "4-5 times per week",
#                                      "> 5 times per week")))


## Check the reference group:
levels(sesam2$VIEWCAT)
contrasts(sesam2$VIEWCAT)

## If necessary, relevel
# sesam <-
#   sesam2 %>%
#   mutate(VIEWCAT = relevel(VIEWCAT, 1))
```

</details>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### {#reg2}

Estimate a multiple regression model wherein *VIEWCAT* predicts *POSTNUMB*.

-   Summarize the model.
-   Interpret the estimates.

<details>

<summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
results <- lm(POSTNUMB ~ VIEWCAT, data = sesam2)
summary(results)
```

  <details>
  
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
  
```{r, include = FALSE}
  tmp <- round(coef(results), 1)
  ci  <- round(confint(results), 1)
  srr <- round(summary(results)$r.squared, 2)
  srf <- summary(results)$fstatistic
```

  A linear model predicting the post-test score of numbers learned based on how
  often a child watched Sesame Street was fit to the data. Viewing category 
  explains a statistically significant proportion of the variance in the data
  ($R^2$ = `r srr`, F(`r srf[2]`, `r srf[3]`) = `r srf[1]`, p = 
  `r pf(srf[1],srf[2],srf[3],lower.tail=F)`).
  
  Kids who never or rarely watched Sesame Street had an average score of
  `r tmp[1]` on the post test for numbers learned. Kids with weekly viewing
  habits of 2-3, 4-5, or 5+ times per week all had significantly higher scores
  on the post-test than kids who never or rarely watched Sesame Street,
  scoring respectively `r tmp[2]`, 95% CI [`r ci[2, 1]`, `r ci[2, 2]`], 
  `r tmp[3]` 95% CI [`r ci[3, 1]`, `r ci[3, 2]`], and `r tmp[4]` 95% CI 
  [`r ci[4, 1]`,`r ci[4, 2]`] higher on the post test than the lowest category
  viewers. 
  
  </details>

</details>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### {.unnumbered}

If we compare the box plot, density, and model output below, the relationships
between the regression coefficient estimates for the viewing categories and
the group means should be evident.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(sesam2, aes(x = VIEWCAT, y = POSTNUMB, color = VIEWCAT)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_boxplot()
p2 <- ggplot(sesam2) +
  geom_density(aes(x = POSTNUMB, fill = VIEWCAT), alpha = .5) +
  theme_minimal()
p3 <- results %>%
  summary() %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2) %>%
  tableGrob()
grid.arrange(arrangeGrob(p1, p2, ncol = 2), p3)
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 

Use `ggplot()` to make a scatterplot with *AGE* on the x-axis and *POSTNUMB* on
the y-axis.

-   Color the points according to the their *VIEWCAT* level.
-   Save the plot object to a variable in your environment.

*Hint:* You can map color to the levels of a variable on your dataset by
assigning the variable names to the `color` argument of the `aes()` function in
`ggplot()`.

<details>

<summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

## Add aes(..., color = VIEWCAT) to get different colors for each group:
p <- ggplot(sesam2, aes(x = AGE, y = POSTNUMB, color = VIEWCAT)) +
  geom_point() # Add points for scatterplot

## Print the plot stored as 'p':
p
```

We assigned the global color aesthetic to the *VIEWCAT* variable, so the points
are colored based on their group.

</details>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 

Add linear regression lines for each group to the above scatterplot.

*Hints:*

-   You can add regression lines with `ggplot2::geom_smooth()`
    -   To get linear regression lines, set the argument `method = "lm"`
    -   To omit error envelopes, set the argument `se = FALSE`

<details>

<summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
## Add OLS best-fit lines:
p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

The global color aesthetic assignment from above carries through to any
additional plot elements that we add, including the regression lines. So, we
also get a separate regression line for each *VIEWCAT* group.

</details>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 

How would you interpret the pattern of regression lines above?

<details>

<summary>Click for explanation</summary>

All the lines show a positive slope, so post-test number recognition appears to
increase along with increasing age. The lines are not parallel, though. So
*VIEWCAT* may be moderating the effect of *AGE* on *POSTNUMB*.

</details>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Moderated Regression {.unnumbered}

Based on the figure we just created, we may want to test for moderation in our
regression model. To do so, we need to add an interaction between *AGE* and
*VIEWCAT*. The *VIEWCAT* factor is represented by
`r (nDum <- nlevels(sesam2$VIEWCAT) - 1)` levels in our model, though. So when
we interact *AGE* and *VIEWCAT*, we will create `r nDum` interaction terms.

To test the overall moderating influence of *VIEWCAT*, we need to conduct a
multiparameter hypothesis test of all `r nDum` interaction terms. One way that
we can go about implementing such a test is through a hierarchical regression
analysis entailing three steps:

1.  Estimate the additive model wherein we regress *POSTNUMB* onto *AGE* and
    *VIEWCAT* without any interaction.
2.  Estimate the moderated model by adding the interaction between *AGE* and
    *VIEWCAT* into the additive model.
3.  Conduct a $\Delta R^2$ test to compare the fit of the two models.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### {#hReg}

Conduct the hierarchical regression analysis described above.

-   Does *VIEWCAT* significantly moderate the effect of *AGE* on *POSTNUMB*?
-   Provide statistical justification for your conclusion.

<details>

<summary>Click to show code</summary>

```{r}
## Estimate the additive model a view the results:
results_add <- lm(POSTNUMB ~ VIEWCAT + AGE, data = sesam2)
summary(results_add)

## Estimate the moderated model and view the results:
results_mod <- lm(POSTNUMB ~ VIEWCAT * AGE, data = sesam2)
summary(results_mod)

## Test for moderation:
anova(results_add, results_mod)
```

  <details>

  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
  
```{r, include = FALSE}
  tmp <- anova(results_add, results_mod)
  
  f   <- tmp[2, 5] %>% round(3)
  df1 <- tmp[2, 3]
  df2 <- tmp[2, 1]
  p   <- tmp[2, 6] %>% round(3)
```
  
  *VIEWCAT* does not significantly moderate the effect of *AGE* on *POSTNUMB*
  ($F[`r df1`, `r df2`] = `r f`$, $p = `r p`$).

  </details>

</details>
