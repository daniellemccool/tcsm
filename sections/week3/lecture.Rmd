## Lecture

Researchers often have theories about possible causal processes linking multiple
variables. Mediation is a particularly important example of such a process in
which in an input variable, X, influences the outcome, Y, through an intermediary
variable, M (the mediator). For instance, psychotherapy (X), may affect thoughts
(M), which in turn affects mood (Y).

We can investigate mediation via a specific sequence of linear regression
equations, but path modeling will make our lives much easier. We can use path
models to simultaneously estimate multiple related regression equations. So,
mediation analysis is an ideal application of path modeling. In this lecture, we
consider both approaches and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses.

As with mediation, researchers often posit theories involving moderation.
Moderation implies that the effect of X on Y depends on another variable, Z. For
instance, the effect of feedback (X) on performance (Y) may depend on age (Z).
Older children might process feedback more effectively than younger children.
Hence, the feedback is more effective for older children than for younger
children, and the effect of feedback on performance is stronger for older
children than for younger children. In such a case, we would say that age
*moderates* the effect of feedback on performance.
