## Lecture

This week, we will begin with our final theme and discuss structural equation
modeling (SEM). This powerful technique joins the strengths of CFA and path 
analysis to produce a highly flexible and theoretically appealing modeling tool.
Essentially, SEM allows us to build structural path models using the latent
variables defined by a CFA.
