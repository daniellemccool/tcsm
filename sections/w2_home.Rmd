## At-Home Exercises

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(foreign)
```

In these exercises, you will attempt to replicate some of the analyses from the 
second reading for this week:

Kestilä, E. (2006). Is there demand for radical right populism in the Finnish 
electorate? *Scandinavian Political Studies 29*(3), 169--191. 
 
The data for this practical were collected during the first round of the 
European Social Survey (ESS). The ESS is a repeated cross-sectional survey
administered in 32 European countries. The first wave was collected in 2002, and 
two new waves have been collected each year since. You can find more info and 
access the data at <https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org>. 

The data we will analyze for this practical are contained in the file named 
*ESSround1-a.sav*. This file contains data for all respondents, but only includes 
those variables that you will need to complete the following exercises. 

---

###

Load the *ESSround1-a.sav* dataset into R.

- Inspect the data after loading to make sure everything went well.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Load the 'foreign' package:
library(foreign)

## Read the 'ESSround1-a.sav' ess into a data frame called 'ess': 
ess <- read.spss("ESSround1-a.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE)

## Inspect the result:
dim(ess)
summary(ess)
str(ess)
```

When you inspect the data, you may notice that almost all variables are 
represented as factors. If so, good eyes! We'll come back to this issue a 
little later.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ess <- read.spss(paste0(dataDir, "ESSround1-a.sav"), to.data.frame = TRUE)

The `ess` dataset contains much more information than Kestilä (2006) used. 
Kestilä only analyzed data from the following ten countries:

- Austria
- Belgium
- Denmark
- Finland
- France
- Germany
- Italy
- Netherlands
- Norway
- Sweden

So, our first task is to subset the data to only the relevant population.  

As explained in \@ref(logicalSubsetting), we can select rows from a dataset
based on logical conditions. In this case, we want to select only rows from the
10 countries listed above.

---

###

Subset the data to include only the 10 countries analyzed by Kestilä (2006).

- Inspect the subsetted data to check that everything went well.

*Hint:* Use the `%in%` operator to create a logical vector that indicates which
elements of the `cntry` variable are *in* the set of target counties.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
## Create a character vector naming the target countries:
targets <- c("Austria", 
             "Belgium", 
             "Denmark", 
             "Finland", 
             "France", 
             "Germany", 
             "Italy", 
             "Netherlands", 
             "Norway", 
             "Sweden")

## Select only those rows that come from a target country:
ess <- ess[ess$cntry %in% targets, ]

## Inspect the result:
dim(ess)
table(ess$cntry)
```

Before we can analyze the data, we need to screen them for problems. At this 
point, we won't get into the nitty-gritty of outlier analysis and data
cleaning. We must, however, ensure that the variables we want to analyze are 
formatted correctly (e.g., interval and ratio variables should be numeric, 
nominal variables should be factors).

---

###

Screen the data to see if the variables are formatted correctly.

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidySEM)

## Check the data structure:
str(ess)

## Compute descriptive statistics:
descriptives(ess)

## Check the levels of one of the spurious factors:
levels(ess$trstlgl)
```

As noted above, one thing you might notice when inspecting the `ess` data is
that nearly all variables are stored as factors.

</details>

---

###

Correct any formatting issues that you discovered above.

In keeping with conventions, we will treat ordinal Likert-type rating scales
with five or more levels as continuous. Consequently, we need to convert these
variables from factors to numeric vectors.

We can convert a factor to a numeric variable using the `as.numeric()` function, 
but this function only operates on one variable at a time. To replicate the 
Kestilä (2006) analysis, we need to convert 37 variables.

Thankfully, we can use *apply* functions to broadcast univariate operation 
across each column (or row) of a dataset. We are specifically interested in
the `lapply()` function. The `lapply()` function applies some function to each
element in a list (e.g., each column in a data frame).

The variables we care about live in columns 7 to 44 of the `ess` dataset. In the 
following code, we apply the `as.numeric()` function to these columns and 
overwrite their original factor versions with the converted numeric data.

```{r}
ess[7:44] <- lapply(ess[7:44], as.numeric)
```

</details>

---

In addition to screening with summary statistics, we can also visualize the
variables' distributions. You have already created a few such visualizations 
for single variables. Now, we will use a few tricks to efficiently plot each
of our target variables.

The first step in this process will be to convert the interesting part of our 
data from "wide format" (one column per variable) into "long format" (one column 
of variable names, one column of data values). The `pivot_longer()` function 
from the `tidyr` package provides a convenient way to execute this conversion.

---

###

Use `tidyr::pivot_longer()` to create a long-formatted data frame from the 
target variables in `ess` (i.e., columns 7 to 44).

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r}
## Load the tidyr package:
library(tidyr)

## Convert the target variables into a long-formatted data frame:
ess_plot <- pivot_longer(ess[7:44], colnames(ess)[7:44])
```

</details>

---

The next step in the process will be to plot the variables using `ggplot()`. To
create one plot for each variable, we will use the `facet_wrap()` function to 
*facet* the plots on the `ess_plot$name` column (i.e., create a separate
conditional plot for each unique value in `ess_plot$name`).

---

###

Use `ggplot()` with an appropriate *geom* (e.g., `geom_histogram()`, 
`geom_density()`, `geom_boxplot()`) and `facet_wrap()` to visualize each of the 
target variables. 

*Hint:* To implement the faceting, simply add 
`facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free_x")` to the end of your `ggplot()` call.

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(ess_plot, aes(x = value)) + 
  geom_histogram() +                    # Create a histogram
  facet_wrap(~ name, scales = "free_x") # Facet on 'name'
```

Notice that the variables are actually discrete (i.e., each variable takes only 
a few integer values). However, most variables look relatively normal despite 
being categorical. So, it's probably fine to analyze these variables as continuous.

</details>

---

###

Check the descriptives for the target variables again. 

- Do you see any remaining issues?

<details>
  <summary>Click for explanation</summary>
  
```{r}
descriptives(ess[7:44])
```

No. Everything looks pretty much fine.

</details>

Now, we're ready to run the analyses and see if we can replicate the Kestilä 
(2006) results. 

---

### {#run_pca}

Run two principal component analyses (PCA): one for *trust in politics*, one for 
*attitudes towards immigration*.

- Use the `principal()` function from the `psych` package.
- Use exactly the same specifications as Kestilä (2006) concerning the estimation 
method, rotation, number of components extracted, etc. 

*Hints:* 

- Remember that you can view the help file for `psych::principal()` by running 
`?psych::principal` or, if the `psych` package already loaded, simply running 
`?principal`.
- When you print the output from `psych::principal()`, you can use the `cut` 
option to hide any factor loadings smaller than a given threshold. 
    - You could consider hiding any loadings smaller than those reported by 
    Kestilä (2006) to make the output easier to interpret.


<details>

#### Trust in politics {-}

Kestilä extracted three components with VARIMAX rotation. 

```{r}
## Load the psych package:
library(psych)

## Run the PCA:
pca_trust <- principal(ess[7:19], nfactors = 3, rotate = "varimax")

## Print the results:
print(pca_trust, cut = 0.3, digits = 3)
```

---

#### Attitudes toward imigration {-}

Kestilä extracted five components with VARIMAX rotation.

```{r}
pca_att <- principal(ess[20:44], nfactors = 5, rotate = "varimax")
print(pca_att, cut = 0.3, digits = 3)
```

</details>

---

*Feature engineering* (i.e., creating new variables by combining and/or 
transforming existing variables) is one of the most common applications of PCA.
PCA is a *dimension reduction* technique that distills the most salient 
information from a set of variables into a (smaller) set of component scores. 
Hence, PCA can be a good way of creating aggregate items (analogous to weighted 
scale scores) when the data are not collected with validated scales.

Principal component scores are automatically generated when we run the PCA. If 
we want to use these scores in subsequent analyses (e.g., as predictors in a 
regression model), we usually add them to our dataset as additional columns.

---

###

Add the component scores produced by the analyses you ran above to 
the `ess` data frame. 

- Give each component score an informative name, based on your interpretation 
of the factor loading matrix 
    - I.e., What hypothetical construct do you think each component represents 
    given the items that load onto it? 

*Hints:*

- You can use the `data.frame()` function to join multiple objects into a single 
data frame.
- You can use the `colnames()` function to assign column names to a matrix or 
data frame.

**1. Extract the component scores**

The object produced by `psych::principal()` is simply list, and the component
scores are already stored therein. So, to extract the component scores, we
simply use the `$` operator to extract them.

```{r}
## Save the component scores in stand-alone matrices: 
trust_scores <- pca_trust$scores
att_scores <- pca_att$scores

## Inspect the result:
head(trust_scores)
summary(trust_scores)
head(att_scores)
summary(att_scores)
```

---

**2. Name the component scores**

```{r}
## Check names (note the order):
colnames(trust_scores)
colnames(att_scores)

## Give informative names:
colnames(trust_scores) <- c("Trust_Institutions", 
                            "Satisfaction", "
                            Trust_Politicians")
colnames(att_scores) <- c("Quantity", 
                          "Effects", 
                          "Refugees", 
                          "Diversity", 
                          "Economic")
```

---

**3. Add the component scores to the dataset**

```{r}
# Add the component scores to the 'ess' data:
ess <- data.frame(ess, trust_scores, att_scores)
```

</details>

Yes, more-or-less. Although the exact estimates differ somewhat, the general 
pattern of factor loadings in Kestilä (2006) matches what we found here.
