How do you know if you have measured the putative hypothetical construct that 
you intend to measure?

- The methods introduced in this lecture (namely, latent variables, factor 
analysis, and reliability analysis) can shed empirical light on this issue. 

In the social and behavioral sciences we're often forced to measure key concepts
indirectly. For example, we have no way of directly quantifying a person's 
current level of depression, or their innate motivation, or their risk-aversion,
or any of the other myriad psychological features that comprise the human mental 
state. In truth, we cannot really *measure* these hypothetical 
constructs at all, we must *estimate* latent representations thereof (though, 
psychometricians still use the language of physical measurement to describe this 
process).

Furthermore, we can rarely estimate an adequate representation with only a single 
observed variable (e.g., question on a survey, score on a test, reading from a 
sensor). We generally need several observed variables to reliably represent a 
single hypothetical construct. For example, we cannot accurately determine 
someoneâ€™s IQ or socio-economic status based on their response to a single 
question; we need several questions that each tap into slightly different 
aspects of IQ or SES. 

Given multiple items measuring the same construct, we can use the methods 
discussed in this lecture (i.e., factor analysis and reliability analysis) to 
evaluate the quality of our measurement (i.e., how well we have estimated the 
underlying hypothetical construct). If we do well enough in this estimation 
task, we will be able to combine these estimated *latent variables* with the 
*path analysis* methods discussed in two weeks to produce the full *structural 
equation models* that we will cover at the end of this course.
