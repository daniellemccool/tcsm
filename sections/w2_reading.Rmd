### Questions 1 {-}

1. What is a latent variable? 
    a. Give an example of a latent variable.
1. What is factor analysis, and what can you investigate using this method? 
1. In the introduction, Preacher and Maccallum describe a “little jiffy” method 
of doing factor analysis. Briefly describe this little jiffy---or bad practice---method. 
1. Briefly explain the key differences between Principal Component Analyses (PCA)
and Exploratory Factor Analyses (EFA). 
1. What is the purpose of factor rotation?

### Answers 1 {-}

1. A latent variable is a variable (i.e. something that differs between research 
subjects or changes within the same subject over time) that we cannot observe 
directly. Rather, we infer the value of a latent variable by combining observed 
variables that each tap into different aspects of the latent variable. 
    a. Almost all psychological, sociological, or cultural constructs are latent 
    variables. Some common examples include IQ, personality, political or racial 
    attitudes, mathematical or artistic ability, etc. 
1. (Exploratory) factor analysis is a statistical method for estimating the 
latent measurement structure that generates a set of measured variables. In other
words, when doing EFA, we're trying to estimate how many latent variables underlie
a set of observed data and which observed items "belong to" which latent variable.
1. The "little jiffy" method consists of the following steps:
    a. Run a PCA to extract facotrs
    a. Apply no subsequent rotation or the varimax rotation
    a. Retain all components with eigenvalues greater than 1.0
    
    This approach results from running "factor analysis" with the SPSS defaults.
    In most situations, however, this setup won't give a meaningful answer to 
    the substantive research questions we're investigating when doing EFA.
1. The main difference between PCA and EFA comes down to how the observed 
variance is factored between the latent variables and the unique (residual) 
factors.
    - PCA directly explains the observed variances. So, if you extract enough 
    components, the latent variables will explain 100% of the observed variance. 
    - EFA allows each observed item to retain its own unique factor to quantify 
    the item variance not explained by the latent variables. Unless you constrain 
    the model, the variance explained by the latent factors should not reach 
    100% of the observed variance. 
1. Factor rotation entails applying linear transformations to "rotate" the 
factor axes (i.e., the geometric representations of the latent variables) through 
the data space to produce a so-called "simple structure" in which each observed 
item loads onto only one factor (to the extent that this is possible). 
    There are two flavors of rotations: 
    - Orthogonal rotation: All latent factors are uncorrelated (i.e. the factor 
    axes describe a 90 degree angle)
    - Oblique rotation: The latent factors are allowed to correlate

### Reference 2 {-}

[
Kestilä, E. (2006). 
Is there demand for radical right populism in the Finnish electorate? 
*Scandinavian Political Studies 29*(3), 169--191.

### Questions 2 {-}

1. What is the research question that the author tries to answer? 
1. Briefly describe the characteristics of the Radical Right Parties (RRP) in 
Europe. 
1. What are the two main explanations of support for RRP upon which this paper 
focuses? 
1. Does the empirical part of the paper reflect the theoretical framework well?
Why or why not?
1. According to the author, is Finland very different from other European 
countries on the main dependent variables? 
1. What is the author's conclusion (i.e., how does the author answer the 
research question)? 

```{asis echo = answer}
### Answers 2 {-}

1. There is no literal passage that can be used, but the research problem 
is stated as “why there is no Radical Right Party in Finland”. The 
question this paper poses is whether the attitudes the Finnish 
electorate holds about trust in politics and immigration is similar to or 
different from the other Western-European countries. 
2. pages 175-177 provide information on this. In short RRP emphasize 
anti-immigrant attitudes and connect immigrations to feelings of 
insecurity, spurring debates about crime. They are protest, anti-elitist 
parties, that often push for lower taxes, while protecting the welfare 
state. They can be clearly placed along the new cleavage in politics 
that is about materialism vs. post-materialism, and reflect the antonym 
of green parties. Finally, they represent the ‘losers’ of modernization 
and emphasize traditional moral values, social norms, the role of the 
family and the importance of a national culture. 
3. the anti-immigration issue and protest voting. 
4. No, Finland is very similar to other (Nordic) European countries. Some 
countries with the most anti-immigrant and anti-politics attitudes, still 
host a RRP. 
5. Anti-immigrant and anti-politics attitudes cannot explain why there is 
no RRP in Finland. The author find the reason for this in history, and 
the fact that politicians from mainstream political parties have caught 
the populist voters.
