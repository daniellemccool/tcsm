## Lecture

In this lecture, we will begin by discussing the \emph{statistical modeling} 
paradigm and contextualizing statistical modeling relative to other ways that we 
can conduct statistical analyses. We will conclude with an introduction to 
\emph{path analysis}.

Once it's ready, the lecture recording will be linked below.
