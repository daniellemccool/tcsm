### Questions {-}

1. What are the differences between a “verbal model” and a “formal model”?
1. As explained in the paragraph “A Brief Note on Statistical Models”, formal 
models are not the same as statistical models. Still, we can learn a lot from 
Smaldino’s approach. Write down three insights from this paper that you would 
like to apply to your statistical modeling during this course.

### Answers {-}

**Q1:**

- A verbal model can be non-specific about many things
    - The level of analysis
    - The definitions of its parts
    - The relationships within the modeled system
- Verbal models can appear powerful and useful partly because they employ 
strategic ambiguity. 
    - Because verbal models are so vague, they can apparently explain many 
    different phenomena, even contradictory ones (e.g., the Cubist chicken). 
- A formal model, on the other hand, seeks to rigorously define its level of 
analysis, parts (variables), and relationships between these parts. 

**Q2:**

- You should define the level of analysis for your model
- You should clearly operationalize the parts (variables) and explicitly define 
the hypothesized relationships (causal, correlational, definitional) between 
these parts
- The act of formally defining our models is productive. We can test a 
well-defined model using data. We can discuss such a model among experts with 
relative consensus about what the model means, and we can improve it. 
    - These things are harder to do with vague verbal models.
- Every model imposes some violence upon reality.
    - I.e., every model is wrong (but some are useful).
- Because a model is a simplification, by necessity, we leave out many factors. 
    - Thinking about how this simplification relates to the third requirement 
    for causality, we see that all alternative causes are ruled out.
- Data can be used to validate a model and to refine the model into a closer 
approximation of reality
