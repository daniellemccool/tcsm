# Software Setup {-}

This Chapter helps you prepare for the course. It shows how to install R and RStudio on your computer. We'll also provide some general information on R, and how you can get help if you get error messages. 

If you're already using R, all of this might be nothing new for you. You may **skip** this chapter then.

If you have **never used R before, this Chapter is essential**, as it gives you some input on how R works, and how we can use it for our data analyses.

## Installing software 

Before we start the course, we have to install three things:

* **R**, a free program for statistical programming
* **RStudio**, a user interface which makes it easier to work with R; overlook our data, packages and output. 
* Several **packages**, which are 'add-ons' for R with functions to do specific analyses. They also include the documentation (help files) that describes how to use them, and sample data.

### Installing R

- The latest R Version is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org)
-	Based on your operating system (Linux, Mac, Windows), click Download.
    -	If you use **Windows**, click Download R for Windows: Find ‘base’ under subdirectories -> Click ‘install R for the first time’ -> Click Download R 3.6.3 (or another version) for Windows
    -	If you use **Mac**, click Download R for (Mac) OS X: Find the header ‘Latest release’ -> Click R-3.6.3.pkg (or another version)
    -	If you use **Linux**, click Download R for Linux: Choose your Linux distribution (debian/, redhat/, suse/, ubuntu/) -> Open the terminal -> Run the installation command

### Installing RStudio

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG(paste0(imageDir, "rstudiologo.PNG"))
grid.raster(img)
```

Download RStudio on the **RStudio** Website ([Link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)). It's free!

### Installing packages {#installpackages}

As a prerequisite for this guide, you need to have a few essential **R packages** installed.

1. Open RStudio
2. Inside RStudio, find the window named **Console** on the bottom left corner of your screen (it might fill the entire left side of the screen).
3. We will now install a few packages using R Code. Here's an overview of the packages, and why we need them:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(
  Package = c("lavaan", 
              "ggplot2", 
              "tidySEM", 
              "semTools", 
              "psych", 
              "foreign", 
              "readxl"),
  Description = c("A sophisticated and user-friendly package for structural equation modeling", 
                  "A flexible and user-friendly package for making graphs", 
                  "Plotting and tabulating the output of SEM-models", 
                  "Comparing models, establishing measurement invariance across groups", 
                  "Descriptive statistics", 
                  "Loading data from SPSS '.sav' files", 
                  "Loading data from Excel '.xslx' files")
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
  
<br><br>

4. To install these packages, we use the `install.packages()` function in R. One package after another, our code should look like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidySEM", dependencies = TRUE)
```

```{block, type='rmdachtung'}
Don't forget to put the package names in `""`. Otherwise, you will get an error message.
```

## Basic usage

### Starting a new project in Rstudio
 
To keep all your work organized, you should use a **project**. In Rstudio, click on the *New project* button:

![](../images/tut_new_proj.png)

In the pop-up dialog, click *New directory*, and again *New project*.

type the desired directory name in the dialog (give it a meaningful name, e.g. "TCSM_course"), and use 'Browse' if you need to change the directory where you store your projects. Now, in your project, click *File > New file > R script*. This script file works just like notepad, or the syntax editor in SPSS: You type plain text, but you can run it any time you want. Conduct all of the exercises in this script file.

### Code conventions

Throughout the guide, a consistent set of conventions is used to refer to code:

* Functions are in a code font and followed by parentheses, like
`sum()` or `mean()`.
* Other R objects (like data or function arguments) are in a code
font, without parentheses, like `seTE` or `method.tau`. 
* Sometimes, we’ll use the package name followed by two colons, like
`lavaan::sem()`. This is valid R code and will run. The `lavaan::` part indicates that the function `sem()` comes from the package `lavaan`.

### Getting Help

As you start to apply the techniques described in this guide to your data you will soon find questions that the guide does not answer. This section describes a few tips on how to get help.

1. Every function in R has documentation (a help file). To see it, select the name of the function and press F1, or run the command `?` followed by the name of the function, e.g.: `?aov`. I have been using R for 10 years, and I still press F1 all the time to see how a function works.
2. Andy Field, the book used for our undergraduate statistics courses [@field2012discovering], is also available for R. Many basic analyses are explained for R in this book.
3. If you get stuck, start with **Google**. Typically, adding “R” to a search is enough to restrict it to relevant results, e.g.: "exploratory factor analysis R". Google is particularly useful for error messages. If you get an error message and you have no idea what it means, try googling it. Chances are that someone else has been confused by it in the past, and there will be help somewhere on the web. (If the error message isn’t in English,
run `Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "en")` and re-run the code; you’re
more likely to find help for English error messages.)
4. If Google doesn’t help, try [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). Start by spending a little time searching for an existing answer; including [R] restricts your search to questions and answers that use R.
5. Lastly, if you stumble upon an error (or typos!) in this guide's text or R syntax, feel free to contact **Caspar van Lissa** at **c.j.vanlissa@uu.nl**.

## Getting the course data

All of the course data files are available on a GitHub repository. You can download them all at once by going to https://github.com/cjvanlissa/TCSM_student, clicking the green button labeled 'Code', and downloading a ZIP archive of the repository.

![](../images/coursematerials.png)

After unzipping the archive, you can open the RStudio project 'TCSM_student.Rproj', and the script 'run_me.R'. This script contains a few lines of code to help you install the required R-packages for the course.
