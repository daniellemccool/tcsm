## Reading

As part of the goal of gaining fluency with R this week, you won't be asked to read an academic article this week, but rather a chapter from Hadley Wickham's book *R for Data Science*. 

Depending on what you find easier, you can either [read the chapter online]("https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html"), or follow along with the primer below. Both cover the same material.
