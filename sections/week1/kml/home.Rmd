## At-Home Exercises

For this week's at-home exercises, you will work through the first of the RStudio 
(Posit) Primers. This first primer comes in two parts covering the basics of 
data visualization and statistical programming.

The Posit.Cloud service won't allow us to embed the primer pages here. So, we've
provided links to each primer below.
