## In-Class Exercises

For this week's in-class exercises, you will continue to work on RStudio (Posit)
Primers. Specifically, you'll work with next three primers. These primers cover
[working with data](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/2), 
[visualizing data](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3),
and [tidying data](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/4). Each primer is 
broken into multiple modules that we've linked below.

### Required Modules

Modules 2.1 through 3.6 cover core functionality that you'll use regularly. So, 
you must complete these nine modules to satisfy the requirements of the in-class
exercises.

#### Primer 2: Working with Data {-} 

- [2.1: Working with Tibbles](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/2.1)
- [2.2: Isolating Data with dplyr](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/2.2)
- [2.3: Deriving Information with dplyr](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/2.3)

#### Primer 3: Visualizing Data {-}

- [3.1: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.1)
- [3.2: Bar Charts](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.2)
- [3.3: Histograms](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.3)
- [3.4: Boxplots \& Counts](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.4)
- [3.5: Scatterplots](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.5)
- [3.6: Line Plots](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.6)

### Optional Modules

The remaining topics are interesting a useful, but they fall a bit too far
outside the remit of this course for us to warrant including them as a required 
exercises. So, you don't need to complete Modules 3.7 through 4.3 to complete
the in-class exercises. You may, however, want to skim these modules and come 
back to this material later, if you run into relevant issues.

#### Primer 3 Continued {-}

- [3.7: Overplotting and Big Data](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.7)
- [3.8: Customizing Plots](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/3.8)

#### Primer 4: Tidying Data {-}

- [4.1: Reshape Data](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/4.1)
- [4.2: Separate \& Unite Columns](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/4.2)
- [4.3: Join Data Sets](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/4.3)
