One of the many benefits of R is its community of users and developers, and the enormous quantity of learning materials that have been developed for teaching new users. For today's lecture [R Basic Basics](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-0/), we turn to the group R-Ladies Sydney who have produced a series of in-depth online learning resources oriented towards beginners.
