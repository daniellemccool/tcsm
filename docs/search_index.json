Lang Last updated: 2022-09-08 Course Information In order to test a theory, we must express the theory as a statistical model and then test this model on quantitative (numeric) data. In this course we will use datasets from different disciplines within the social sciences (educational sciences, psychology, and sociology) to explain and illustrate theories and practices that are used in all social science disciplines to statistically model social science theories. This course uses existing tutorial datasets to practice the process of translating verbal theories into testable statistical models. If you are interested in the methods of acquiring high quality data to test your own theory, we recommend following the course Conducting a Survey which is taught from November to January.

After completing the course, you will be able to: Translate a verbal theory into a conceptual model, and translate a conceptual model into a statistical model. Independently analyze data using the free, open-source statistical software R. Apply a latent variable model to a real-life problem wherein the observed variables are only indirect indicators of an unobserved construct. Use a path model to represent the hypothesized causal relations among several variables, including relationships such as mediation and moderation. Explain to a fellow student how structural equation modeling combines latent variable models with path models and the benefits of doing so.

RStudio helps you use and learn R more easily. Although you are interacting with RStudio, you are still using R. Don’t ever write something like, “We conducted all analysis with RStudio…” For this course, all tutorials and practicals will use RStudio. 0.5.1 No ‘pane’, no gain! When you open RStudio, the screen should look something like the following image. You will notice that the window is divided into ‘panes’ (a pane is a division of a window). Before we explain these three panes, I want you to add another, which you will see if you open an R script. An R script is simply a plain-text file wherein you will write the R code that executes your analyses. When you open an R script (or create a new one, which is really the same thing), a fourth pane appears. 0.5.2 Create a new R script To create a new R script, Click the icon with a plus sign on the paper (highlighted below by the red square). When you click this icon, a new script is generated and appears in a fourth pane on the upper left side of the screen (if you’re using the default layout). Note that this script is not yet saved anywhere. If you close this script without saving, you will lose all its contents. The four panes help organize your workflow. Rstudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is meant to integrate all of the tasks you may need to do for any R-based analysis, programming, or development. Hence, in RStudio, the intended workflow will have you do everything in one window, and the four panes make this workflow more efficient (in theory, at least). 0.5.3 What do the four panes do? Note that the following descriptions apply to the default layout. You can change the orientation and content of the panes (although you must always have four). Source Pane: Located in the top left quadrant. This pane is also called the “Editor”, because this is where we edit scripts. We will usually type our code in the source pane. Console Pane: Located in the bottom left quadrant. This pane is for direct communication with R. We can type commands here that are immediately evaluated (whereas the commands in a script are only evaluated when we explicitly run them). Furthermore, all output from the R commands that we run (either via the console or a script) is printed in the console pane. The two panes on the right side of the window contain various tabs. Two of these tabs are especially useful. Environment Tab: Located in the upper right quadrant The environment tab contains all the ‘objects’ currently loaded in your R session. You can always check what objects are loaded under the environment tab. The ‘environment’ is also called the ‘workspace’ Plots Tab: Located in the lower right quadrant The plots tab shows any graphs and figures we draw via R commands. If you zoom by clicking the magnifying glass icon, you can see enlarged versions of the plots. "],["rstudio-projects.html", "0.6 RStudio projects", " 0.6 RStudio projects To keep all your work organized, you can use an RStudio Project. One advantage of using RStudio projects is that the project directory is automatically set as the working directory. If you save your data in the directory that contains the “.Rproj” file, you will can load the data without specifying the file path. 0.6.1 Starting a new project in Rstudio In Rstudio, click on the New project button: In the pop-up dialog, click New Directory. Click New Project. Type the desired directory name in the dialog box Give a meaningful name, e.g., “TCSM_Course”. Use the Browse button if you need to change the location of the directory that you will use to store this project. "],["loading-data.html", "0.7 Loading data", " 0.7 Loading data Statistical analysis cannot happen without data. In R, you can load data in various ways. Let’s go over a couple of these. To complete the following exercise, first download the LifeSat.sav data. 0.7.1 Via clicky-box options Click through the following menu options: File &gt; Import Dataset Choose the type of dataset. For this exercise, the data are stored as an SPSS .sav file. Thus, select the From SPSS option. You may encounter an Install Required Packages pop-up dialog with a message that asks you whether you want to install the haven package. A package is an a piece of add-on software for R. To do most analyses, you will need some packages above-and-beyond the Base R software. In this case, haven contains functions that allow R to read SPSS data files. Click ‘Yes’ to install the package. At this point, the Import Statistical Data pop-up dialog should appear. Provide the location of your data file in the File/URL field. You can type the file path directly. You can also click Browse to find the file via a GUI interface. You should now see your data in the Data Preview area. In the Import Options section, you can set the name and format of your data file. All of your your selections are being translated to the R-code required to load your file. In the Code Preview area, the steps required to load the data with your selected options are expressed in terms of code. Finally, click Import at the lower right side of the window to load your data. 0.7.2 Via R code Of course, we don’t have to use tedious clicky-box processes. Once you get more familiar with R, it will be much easier to load data with R code. For this exercise, we will use the read.spss() function from the foreign package. Copy the following code into an R-script. Note that this code assumes you have saved your data in the working directory (this is the project directory if you’re using an R project). Otherwise, you will need to specify the file path to your data file as the first argument. library(foreign) LifeSat &lt;- read.spss(&quot;LifeSat.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE, use.value.labels = FALSE) To run the code: Place your cursor on the first line of code. Press the Ctrl/Cmd + Enter keys together. The code should now be evaluated by R, and R will tell you the result of its actions in the console pane. 0.7.2.1 Data frames When we read data into R, the data are most often stored as a special type of object called a data frame. Data frames are the preferred way to handle data in R. Data frames can hold variables with different types (e.g., a numeric depression rating, a categorical grouping factor representing employment status, and a character string recording the response to an open-ended question). The option to.data.frame = TRUE in the read.spss() call above loads the data into a data frame. 0.7.3 From Excel files We can also load data that are stored in Excel files. One way to do so is via the readxl package. ## Load the package: library(readxl) ## Read the first sheet of &#39;LifeSat.xlsx&#39; into &#39;LifeSat&#39;: LifeSat &lt;- read_excel(&quot;LifeSat.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 1) "],["exploring-data-via-r-functions.html", "0.8 Exploring data via R functions", " 0.8 Exploring data via R functions If you look a bit more closely at the R code that we used to load the data, you will see two special commands: library() and read.spss(). These commands are called functions. Any R command that is written as a name followed by parentheses, e.g., mean(), is a function. Functions are the driving force behind all R-based data analysis. Functions tell R to perform a specific (potentially very complicated) task. Rather than having to write out along sequence of commands every time we want to do some task, we can simply call the appropriate function. When using functions, you need to provide appropriate inputs to specify the behavior of the function and give the function data on which to operate. These inputs are called function arguments. Let’s explore three new functions and their arguments. These functions can help us understand our data. 0.8.1 head() Our data comprise many rows. We can use the head() function to inspect the first several rows. To use the head() function, you only need to provide one argument: The name of the dataset. ## Inspect the first several rows head(LifeSat) “Wait, what is the hash tag (#) doing there?” Don’t be surprised. The hash tag creates a “comment”. I.e., a bit of text that will not be evaluated by R. Comments let us write notes to explain what a particular piece of code does. Comments are doubly useful. They can help others understand your code. They can also help you remember what the code does after some time away. Copy the preceding code into your R script and run it. If all went well, R should now show the first six rows of the dataset in the console. 0.8.2 str() We frequently want to know something about the types of variables in a dataset. For example, if you want to run an analysis of variance (ANOVA), the independent variable(s) should be categorical. In R, these variables would be represented by a special type of variable called a factor. Before running our analysis, we should check if are data satisfy this requirement. We can use the str() function to get some information about the structure of an R object (str is an abbreviation of structure). To run the str() function, you only need to provide one argument: the name of the dataset. ## Inspect the structure of the dataset str(LifeSat) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 98 obs. of 8 variables: ## $ LifSat : num 13 18 19 24 24 24 30 33 33 33 ... ## $ age : num 75 75 72 72 70 73 72 72 68 73 ... ## $ educ : num 6 5 5 6 5 6 6 5 7 6 ... ## $ gender : num 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;value.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:2] &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;male&quot; &quot;female&quot; ## $ female : num 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 ... ## $ ChildSup: num 4 6 6 6 6 8 8 7 4 8 ... ## $ SpouSup : num 2 5 5 4 5 6 4 6 2 8 ... ## $ SES : num 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;value.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:3] &quot;3&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:3] &quot;high SES&quot; &quot;middle SES&quot; &quot;low SES&quot; ## - attr(*, &quot;variable.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:8] &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;Years of education&quot; &quot;&quot; ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:8] &quot;LifSat&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;educ&quot; &quot;gender&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;codepage&quot;)= int 1252 According to the output printed to the console, the LifeSat dataset is a data frame consisting of 98 observations of 8 variables. I.e., our dataset has 98 rows and 8 columns. We also get information about the contents of each column. For the fist column, we see $ LifSat : num 13 18 19 24 24 24 30 33 33 33 ... The LifSat variable is numeric (abbreviated as num). 13 is the value in the first row, 18 is the value in the second row, 19 is the value in the third row, and so on. 0.8.3 summary() We can get the descriptive statistics of the variables in a dataset with the summary() function. Again, we only need to provide one argument: the name of the dataset. summary(LifeSat) ## LifSat age educ gender ## Min. : 13.00 Min. :64.00 Min. : 4.000 Min. :1.000 ## 1st Qu.: 44.25 1st Qu.:68.25 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.:1.000 ## Median : 58.00 Median :70.00 Median : 6.000 Median :1.000 ## Mean : 57.86 Mean :70.26 Mean : 6.541 Mean :1.449 ## 3rd Qu.: 69.75 3rd Qu.:72.00 3rd Qu.: 7.000 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :100.00 Max. :75.00 Max. :12.000 Max. :2.000 ## female ChildSup SpouSup SES ## Min. :0.000 Min. : 3.000 Min. : 2.000 Min. :1.000 ## 1st Qu.:0.000 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.: 5.000 1st Qu.:1.000 ## Median :1.000 Median : 7.000 Median : 6.000 Median :2.000 ## Mean :0.551 Mean : 6.857 Mean : 6.061 Mean :1.918 ## 3rd Qu.:1.000 3rd Qu.: 8.000 3rd Qu.: 8.000 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :1.000 Max. :10.000 Max. :10.000 Max. :3.000 Run the above code and check the output in the console. You should see descriptive statistics for each variable in the dataset. E.g., for LifSat, the minimum value is 13, the median is 58, and the mean is 57.86. "],["tutorialPlotting.html", "0.9 Plotting data", " 0.9 Plotting data It is almost always a good idea to visualize your data before you dive into a full statistical analysis. For example, you may like to know something about the nature of the relationship between two specific variables, the distribution of some set of values, etc. In this section, we will create three basic plots of our data. When we create these plots, the figures will appear in the plots tab in the lower right quadrant of the RStudio window. 0.9.1 R packages and ggplot2 We will use the ggplot2 package for plotting. This package is not part of the Base R installation. So, you must install ggplot2 yourself (you should have already done so in Section 0.2.3). You only need to install an R package once. R packages are just small software programs, so they must be installed just like any other piece of software. After installing, the package is accessible on your computer but not yet available for use in your current R session. You must first load the package. You need to load the package every time you want to use it in a new R session. After loading, the package contents (i.e., functions, help files, datasets) are initialized in memory and ready to use in your current R session. Loading a package is more-or-less equivalent to ‘opening’ a software program by clicking on its desktop icon. Run the following code to load the ggplot2 package. library(ggplot2) 0.9.2 Histogram We can use a histogram to visualize how the values of a continuous variable are distributed. ## Use the &#39;LifeSat&#39; data to create the plot ## Use the &#39;LifeSat$LifSat&#39; variable to define the X-axis ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat)) + geom_histogram() # Create a histogram from the data/variable defined above 0.9.3 Boxplot A boxplot provides another useful visualization of a condituous variable’s distribution. We can also use boxplots to detect outliers. ## Same data/variable setup as above: ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat)) + geom_boxplot() # Create a boxplot 0.9.4 Scatterplot A scatterplot provides a visual representation of the relationship between two variables. Since we are now plotting two variables, we need to define a y variable in addition to thex variable specified in the previous examples. ## Add the &#39;age&#39; variable on the Y-axis: ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat, y = age)) + geom_point() # Create a scatterplot "],["manipulating-data.html", "0.10 Manipulating Data", " 0.10 Manipulating Data 0.10.1 Data types Recall the output of the str() function. One piece of information contained therein is the type of data stored in each column of our dataset. There a different abbreviations signifying different types of data. Abbreviation Type Description num Numeric All values are numbers (e.g., 1.02) chr Character All values are words log Logical Boolean flags: TRUE or FALSE factor Factor A special type of object with labels to represent the levels of a categorical variable 0.10.2 Factors Factors are a special type of data object that R uses to represent categorical variables. A factor is stored internally as a vector of integers where each group is represented by a different number. The groups also get descriptive labels. R knows that a factor is not numeric and will treat any factor as a nominal grouping variable for anlaysis. In the output from the str() function in 0.8.2, we see that the gender variable is stored as a numeric variable. You can confirm by running either of the following commands. is.numeric(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] TRUE class(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; The gender varible is a binary grouping variable, so it should be stored as a factor. To convert gender to a factor, we can use the factor() function. ## Convert &#39;gender&#39; to a factor: LifeSat$gender &lt;- factor(LifeSat$gender) ## Check the results: is.numeric(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] FALSE class(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; str(LifeSat$gender) ## Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;: 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 ... We now see that gender has been converted to a factor with the levels “1” and “2”. We don’t have to settle for meaningless numeric labels, though. We can assign meaningful value labels by providing an appropriate input for the labels argument. ## Create a factor with meaningful labels: LifeSat$gender &lt;- factor(LifeSat$gender, labels = c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;)) ## Check the results: str(LifeSat$gender) ## Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;: 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 ... 0.10.3 Subsetting: Extracting one variable When working with data frames, we can extract a single variable (i.e., column) from the data using the dollar sign operator, $. As shown in the example below. # Extract the &#39;LifSat&#39; variable from &#39;LifeSat&#39;: LifeSat$LifSat ## [1] 13 18 19 24 24 24 30 33 33 33 33 33 35 35 37 37 41 41 41 ## [20] 43 43 43 44 44 44 45 47 48 48 48 50 51 51 52 53 53 53 53 ## [39] 54 55 55 56 56 56 57 58 58 58 58 58 58 59 59 60 61 61 63 ## [58] 63 63 65 66 67 67 67 67 68 68 68 69 69 69 69 69 70 70 70 ## [77] 71 72 74 74 76 77 77 78 78 79 79 79 81 81 82 83 85 86 87 ## [96] 91 99 100 In the above code, we ask R to extract the column named LifSat from the data frame named LifeSat. The result will be returned as another special type of object: a vector. 0.10.4 Subsetting: Extracting rows and columns We can also extract rectangular subsets of a data frame using the following convention: my_data_frame[row_numbers, column_numbers]. ## Extract the first four rows of the first two columns: LifeSat[1:4, 1:2] By leaving either rows or columns empty, we get all rows or columns: ## Extract all rows of first two columns: LifeSat[ , 1:2] ## Extract all columns of first two rows: LifeSat[1:2, ] We can refer to the columns by name, too: LifeSat[1:2, c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;educ&quot;)] 0.10.5 Subsetting based on logical conditions We can also select rows or columns that satisfy logical conditions. In the following code, we select only the rows for which LifeSat$age is greater than 70.

Below, we select only the males and save the subset as a new object, LifeSat_male.

The following code will extract the 5th entry in the LifSat variable. LifeSat[5, &quot;LifSat&quot;] ## [1] 24 Actually, it’s not really accurate to say that the above code “extracts” any value. The above command creates a new temporary object containing only the relevant value and prints the contents of that object to the console. All the subsetting examples above (other than the selection of all males) have done something similar. Rather than thinking about the [] or $ selection operators as ways of extracting pieces of a data object, it’s more appropriate to think about these operators as selecting, highlight, activating, nominating (or some other such concept) the referenced elements. Once the elements are so selected, we can also overwrite their original values. We only need to assign new values to the subset. To demonstrate, let’s overwrite the value selected above with 10. ## Overwrite the 5th &#39;LifSat&#39; value: LifeSat[5, &quot;LifSat&quot;] &lt;- 10 ## Check the result: LifeSat[5, &quot;LifSat&quot;] ## [1] 10 "],["getting-help.html", "0.11 Getting Help", " 0.11 Getting Help As you start to apply the techniques described in this guide, you will soon have questions that the guide does not answer. This section describes a few tips on how to get help answering these questions. Every function in R has documentation (i.e., a help file). To see this file in RStudio, select the name of the function in your script, and press F1, or run the command ? followed by the name of the function (e.g., ?aov). The second option works outside of RStudio, too. If you get stuck, start with Google. Typically, adding “R” to a search is enough to return relevant results (e.g., “exploratory factor analysis R”). Google is particularly useful for error messages. If you get an error message that you don’t understand, try googling it. Someone else has almost certainly been confused by the same message in the past, and there will be help somewhere on the web. If the error message isn’t in English, run Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = \"en\") and re-run the code that produced the error (you’re more likely to find help for English error messages.) If Google doesn’t help, try stackoverflow. Before posting your question, spend some time searching the site for an existing answer (active contributors really hate it when you ask a question that has already been answered on the site). Including [R] in your search string restricts your search to questions and answers that use R.

We use the F statistic for the overall test of model fit to support this conclusion. The variables age and prenumb together explain 45.9% of the variability in postnumb. 1.5.2.3 Write the null and alternative hypotheses for tested in 1.5.2.2. Click for explanation Since we are testing for explained variance, our hypotheses concern the \\(R^2\\). \\[ \\begin{align*} H_0:$ R^2 = 0\\\\ H_1:$ R^2 &gt; 0 \\end{align*} \\] Note that this is a directional hypotheses because the \\(R^2\\) cannot be negative. 1.5.2.4 Consider the path model below. How many regression coefficients are estimated in this model? How many variances are estimated? How many covariances are estimated? How many degrees of freedom does this model have? Hint: As you learned in Lecture 1, \\(df = N_{obs} – N_{par}\\). 1.5.2.5 Consider a multiple regression analysis with three continuous independent variables: scores on tests of language, history, and logic, and one continuous dependent variable: score on a math test. We want to know if scores on the language, history, and logic tests can predict the math test score. Sketch a path model that you could use to answer this question How many regression parameters are there? How many variances could you estimate? How many covariances could you estimate? How many degrees of freedom does this model have? 1.5.3 Part 3: ANOVA 1.5.3.1 Load the Drivers.sav data. # Read the data into a data frame named &#39;drivers&#39;: drivers &lt;- read.spss(&quot;Drivers.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE) In this section, we will use ANOVA to evaluate the following research question: Does talking on the phone interfere with people’s driving skills? These data come from an experiment. The condition variable represents the three experimental conditions: Hand-held phone Hands-free phone Control (no phone) We will use condition as the IV in our ANOVA models. The DV, RT, represents the participant’s reaction time (in milliseconds) during a driving simulation. As you may know, the mathematical model underlying ANOVA is just a linear regression model with nominal IVs. The only difference between ANOVA and regression analysis is the focus of the analysis. In regression analysis, we focus on inference about the coefficients. In ANOVA, we focus on the overall effect of entire grouping factors. When doing ANOVA in R, we estimate the model exactly as we would for linear regression; we simply summarize the results differently. 1.5.3.2 Perform the ANOVA to test the above research question. Hint: After estimating the model with lm(), you can use the anova() function to compute the sums-of-squares and significance tests for each factor in your model.

In particular, we should probably check at least three conditions: There are no overly influential cases The residual variance is homogonous across groups The residuals are normally distributed 1.5.3.3 Check for influential cases. Hint: You can use the cooks.distance() function to compute Cook’s Distance statistic for each observation. Observations with Cook’s D values substantially larger than, and qualitatively distinct from, the rest of the data may be overly influential. You can evaluate the relative sizes of the distances by making an index plot of the estimated distance statistics. Click for explanation ## Compute the Cook&#39;s distances: d &lt;- cooks.distance(results) ## Plot the distances: plot(d) In the figure above, we’re looking for any distances that clearly “stand out from the crowd”. None of the distances in the above figure look notable. We do not see evidence of influential observations. 1.5.3.4 Check the normality of the residuals. Hints: One of the best ways to check the normality of residuals is with a Normal QQplot. We can easily create a Normal QQ-Plot of the residuals by plotting the results object from 1.5.3.2. Click for explanation plot(results, 2) In the QQ-Plot created above, we want to see all of the points follow the diagonal, dashed line. Perfectly normal residuals will fall exactly along this line Deviations away from the line indicate devations from normality. The residuals in this figure look quite good. We only see very minor deviations from the idealized line. The residuals appear to be more-or-less normally distributed. 1.5.3.5 Check the homogeneity of the residual variances. Hints: A scale-location plot is one of the best ways to check the homogeneity of variances assumption. Plot an estimate of the residual variance against the predicted values Any trend indicates differences in residual variance between groups Plotting the results object from 1.5.3.2 will also produce a scale-location plot. Click for explanation plot(results, 3) The red line in this figure is a loess line which represents the trend of the plotted data. If this loess line is flat, there is no evidence of differences in the residual variances between groups. Trends in this line indicate violations of the homogeneity assumption. In this case, the line is pretty much flat and we have little-to-no evidence of heterogeneous residual variances. 1.5.3.6 Summarize your conclusions regarding the assumption. Are the assumptions satisfied? Can we trust the model results? Click for explanation There are no observations that stand out as particularly influential. Furthermore, we have no evidence of heterogeneous residual variances or substantial violations of normality for the residuals. Hence, the assumptions appear to be satisfied, and we can trust the conclusions of our analysis. 1.5.3.7 Use your results to answer the research question. Click for explanation anova(results) The effect of condition on RT was nonsignificant (\\(F[2, 57] = 3.07\\), \\(p = 0.054\\)). Therefore, based on these results, we do not have evidence for an effect of mobile phone usage on driving performance. 1.5.4 Part 4: ANCOVA We will now conduct an ANCOVA to assess the following research question. Are there differences in reaction times between the conditions after controlling for age? As with ANOVA, the statistical model underlying an ANCOVA is simply a linear regression model. The model for an ANCOVA, however, includes at least one continuous covariate in addition to the categorical IVs. Consequently, when we conduct ANCOVA in R, we again use the lm() function to estimate the model. 1.5.4.1 Estimate the ANCOVA model needed to test the above research question. Click for explanation As you can see above, when we run an ANCOVA, we’re just estimating a multiple linear regression model. We call the analysis ANCOVA because we are interested in a specific hypothesis. Our substantive interest lies in the categorical IVs. The continuous covariates are uninteresting, nuisance variables that we are controlling for to get better estimates of the interesting treatment effects. One implication of this hypothesis is the absence of any interaction between the covariates and grouping factors. If the covariate moderates the treatment effect, the covariate has a direct impact on the substantively interesting group differences. Such a covariate is not a covariate; it’s a substantively integral feature of the model. If we want to report our analysis as an ANCOVA, we need to show that the covariate effects are equivalent in each group. In other words, there is no interaction between the grouping factors and the covariates. 1.5.4.2 Test for an interaction between age and condition in the model from 1.5.4.1. What is your conclusion? Can we report our analysis as an ANCOVA? Hint: You can include an interaction term in an R formulas ‘multiplying’ the two variable names using the * operator. Click for explanation The interaction between condition and age is not significant (\\(F[2, 54] = 1.07\\), \\(p = 0.349\\)). Therefore, the covariate effects should be more-or-less equivalent in each group, and we can report our analysis as an ANCOVA. 1.5.4.3 Answer the research from above question. If you did find a significant, partial effect of condition, do a post hoc comparison of pairwise mean differences to see which groups showed significantly different reaction times, after controlling for age. Use Tukey’s HSD correction for all pairwise comparisons to control the Type I error rate. Hints: You can conduct the appropriate post hoc test with the TukeyHSD() function. The TukeyHSD() function only works on models estimated using the aov() function (which is the same as lm() but summarizes the results in ANOVA style). To satisfy TukeyHSD(), you can either rerun your model with aov() or convert your results object to the correct format via aov(results). Click for explanation ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = results) ## ## $condition ## diff lwr upr p adj ## hands-free-hand-held -36.95 -118.5708 44.67082 0.5242511 ## control-hand-held -100.75 -182.3708 -19.12918 0.0119407 ## control-hands-free -63.80 -145.4208 17.82082 0.1533777 After controlling for age, phone usage significantly affects driving performance (\\(F[2, 56] = 4.52\\), \\(p = 0.015\\)). Specifically, the hand-held condition has a significant higher reaction time than the control condition. 1.5.5 Part 5: More Regression 1.5.5.1 Load the Sesam2.sav data. # Load the data and put them in the object called &quot;data&quot; data &lt;- read.spss(&quot;Sesam2.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE) Use postnumb as the dependent variable in all the following analyses. 1.5.5.2 Viewcat is a factor variable, but is not coded as such in the data. Turn it into a factor. Afterwards, make sure that viewcat=1 is the reference group in the contrasts, i.e., the group that is identified by zero scores on all the associated dummy variables. Hint: Use &lt;- factor() and contrasts().

How can you determine the average postnumb score for each of the viewcat categories, based on the regression parameters? 1.5.5.5 Make a coloured scatter plot with age on the x-axis and postnumb on the y-axis. Colour the dots according to the their viewcat category. How do you interpret the differences in slopes of these four fit lines? Hint: Use ggplot() and geom_point(); use the argument aes(colour = ‘…’) to map colour to a certain variable. A new command is geom_smooth() : This plots a smooth line (like a regression line). Click for explanation We will use ggplot again: ggplot(data, aes(x = AGE, y = POSTNUMB, colour = VIEWCAT)) + geom_point() + # For scatterplot geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) + # For regression lines theme_bw() # For a pretty theme 1.5.5.6 Add an interaction between age and viewcat to the regression analysis.
