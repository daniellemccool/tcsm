Lang Last updated: 2022-10-06 Course Information In order to test a theory, we must express the theory as a statistical model and then test this model on quantitative (numeric) data. In this course we will use datasets from different disciplines within the social sciences (educational sciences, psychology, and sociology) to explain and illustrate theories and practices that are used in all social science disciplines to statistically model social science theories. This course uses existing tutorial datasets to practice the process of translating verbal theories into testable statistical models. If you are interested in the methods of acquiring high quality data to test your own theory, we recommend following the course Conducting a Survey which is taught from November to January.

After completing the course, you will be able to: Translate a verbal theory into a conceptual model, and translate a conceptual model into a statistical model. Independently analyze data using the free, open-source statistical software R. Apply a latent variable model to a real-life problem wherein the observed variables are only indirect indicators of an unobserved construct. Use a path model to represent the hypothesized causal relations among several variables, including relationships such as mediation and moderation. Explain to a fellow student how structural equation modeling combines latent variable models with path models and the benefits of doing so.

If you’re one of the majority without data, you’ll have to find an existing dataset to analyze (in case you were wondering, you won’t have time to collect new data). Sources Those who need data can make use of one of the myriad publicly available datasets available online. Of course these datasets will vary widely in terms of their applicability to the project and the amount of work required to prepare the variables for analysis. The following links point to various sources of publicly available data. Kaggle datasets GSS Sata Explorer StatLine Open Data Open Data from the Dutch Government Google Cloud Platform Google dataset search Tips When searching for a suitable dataset, consider the following tips: It will take longer than you expect. Start searching for data early. Plan on devoting a good chunk of time to tracking down a useful dataset. Realize that even after you find the data, you will also have to do a good bit of cleaning to get the variables ready for analysis. Expect to be disappointed. You may find a dataset that looks good on paper but won’t work for the project (e.g., too much missing data, poor coverage for key relations, jenky distributions, etc.). You usually won’t discover these issue until you’ve already downloaded the data and started exploring/cleaning. Make sure you check the actual data you’ve downloaded before you declare success in your search. Keep the project requirements in mind when searching for data. You will need, at least, three interesting variables to model in some sort of causal process (required for Assignment 3). You will need, at least, one latent variable (required for Assignments 1 &amp; 3). To define a latent variable, you need multiple items (at least three) measuring the same hypothetical construct. In practice, these multiple indicators usually come from scales (e.g., NEO-PI Big Five Personality Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory). If you find a dataset that looks suitable, but you want to confirm, send me (Kyle) a link to the dataset, and I’ll let you know if it will work for the assignments.

Length In the preceding three sections, some line-items in the descriptions of the assignments concluded with a word count. These sections of your report must conform to the indicated word counts. E.g., the Data section of Assignment 1 must contain no more that 150 words, and the Discussion section of Assignment 3 must contain no more than 500 words. In all other sections, you may use as many words as necessary to adequately explain yourself (though concision and parsimony are still encouraged). Note that the assignments are not intended to be full-blown papers! You only get a few hundred words to describe your data, justify your theoretical model, and discuss the results. The focus should be on the definition of your model, how this model relates to theory (introduction), and what you have learned from your estimated model (discussion).

RStudio helps you use and learn R more easily. Although you are interacting with RStudio, you are still using R. Don’t ever write something like, “We conducted all analysis with RStudio…” For this course, all tutorials and practicals will use RStudio. 0.5.1 No ‘pane’, no gain! When you open RStudio, the screen should look something like the following image. You will notice that the window is divided into ‘panes’ (a pane is a division of a window). Before we explain these three panes, I want you to add another, which you will see if you open an R script. An R script is simply a plain-text file wherein you will write the R code that executes your analyses. When you open an R script (or create a new one, which is really the same thing), a fourth pane appears. 0.5.2 Create a new R script To create a new R script, Click the icon with a plus sign on the paper (highlighted below by the red square). When you click this icon, a new script is generated and appears in a fourth pane on the upper left side of the screen (if you’re using the default layout). Note that this script is not yet saved anywhere. If you close this script without saving, you will lose all its contents. The four panes help organize your workflow. Rstudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is meant to integrate all of the tasks you may need to do for any R-based analysis, programming, or development. Hence, in RStudio, the intended workflow will have you do everything in one window, and the four panes make this workflow more efficient (in theory, at least). 0.5.3 What do the four panes do? Note that the following descriptions apply to the default layout. You can change the orientation and content of the panes (although you must always have four). Source Pane: Located in the top left quadrant. This pane is also called the “Editor”, because this is where we edit scripts. We will usually type our code in the source pane. Console Pane: Located in the bottom left quadrant. This pane is for direct communication with R. We can type commands here that are immediately evaluated (whereas the commands in a script are only evaluated when we explicitly run them). Furthermore, all output from the R commands that we run (either via the console or a script) is printed in the console pane. The two panes on the right side of the window contain various tabs. Two of these tabs are especially useful. Environment Tab: Located in the upper right quadrant The environment tab contains all the ‘objects’ currently loaded in your R session. You can always check what objects are loaded under the environment tab. The ‘environment’ is also called the ‘workspace’ Plots Tab: Located in the lower right quadrant The plots tab shows any graphs and figures we draw via R commands. If you zoom by clicking the magnifying glass icon, you can see enlarged versions of the plots.

To complete the following exercise, first download the LifeSat.sav data. 0.7.1 Via clicky-box options Click through the following menu options: File &gt; Import Dataset Choose the type of dataset. For this exercise, the data are stored as an SPSS .sav file. Thus, select the From SPSS option. You may encounter an Install Required Packages pop-up dialog with a message that asks you whether you want to install the haven package. A package is an a piece of add-on software for R. To do most analyses, you will need some packages above-and-beyond the Base R software. In this case, haven contains functions that allow R to read SPSS data files. Click ‘Yes’ to install the package. At this point, the Import Statistical Data pop-up dialog should appear. Provide the location of your data file in the File/URL field. You can type the file path directly. You can also click Browse to find the file via a GUI interface. You should now see your data in the Data Preview area. In the Import Options section, you can set the name and format of your data file. All of your your selections are being translated to the R-code required to load your file. In the Code Preview area, the steps required to load the data with your selected options are expressed in terms of code. Finally, click Import at the lower right side of the window to load your data. 0.7.2 Via R code Of course, we don’t have to use tedious clicky-box processes. Once you get more familiar with R, it will be much easier to load data with R code. For this exercise, we will use the read.spss() function from the foreign package. Copy the following code into an R-script. Note that this code assumes you have saved your data in the working directory (this is the project directory if you’re using an R project). Otherwise, you will need to specify the file path to your data file as the first argument. library(foreign) LifeSat &lt;- read.spss(&quot;LifeSat.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE, use.value.labels = FALSE) To run the code: Place your cursor on the first line of code. Press the Ctrl/Cmd + Enter keys together. The code should now be evaluated by R, and R will tell you the result of its actions in the console pane. 0.7.2.1 Data frames When we read data into R, the data are most often stored as a special type of object called a data frame. Data frames are the preferred way to handle data in R. Data frames can hold variables with different types (e.g., a numeric depression rating, a categorical grouping factor representing employment status, and a character string recording the response to an open-ended question). The option to.data.frame = TRUE in the read.spss() call above loads the data into a data frame. 0.7.3 From Excel files We can also load data that are stored in Excel files. One way to do so is via the readxl package. ## Load the package: library(readxl) ## Read the first sheet of &#39;LifeSat.xlsx&#39; into &#39;LifeSat&#39;: LifeSat &lt;- read_excel(&quot;LifeSat.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 1) "],["exploring-data-via-r-functions.html", "0.8 Exploring data via R functions", " 0.8 Exploring data via R functions If you look a bit more closely at the R code that we used to load the data, you will see two special commands: library() and read.spss(). These commands are called functions. Any R command that is written as a name followed by parentheses, e.g., mean(), is a function. Functions are the driving force behind all R-based data analysis. Functions tell R to perform a specific (potentially very complicated) task. Rather than having to write out along sequence of commands every time we want to do some task, we can simply call the appropriate function. When using functions, you need to provide appropriate inputs to specify the behavior of the function and give the function data on which to operate. These inputs are called function arguments. Let’s explore three new functions and their arguments. These functions can help us understand our data. 0.8.1 head() Our data comprise many rows. We can use the head() function to inspect the first several rows. To use the head() function, you only need to provide one argument: The name of the dataset. ## Inspect the first several rows head(LifeSat) “Wait, what is the hash tag (#) doing there?” Don’t be surprised. The hash tag creates a “comment”. I.e., a bit of text that will not be evaluated by R. Comments let us write notes to explain what a particular piece of code does. Comments are doubly useful. They can help others understand your code. They can also help you remember what the code does after some time away. Copy the preceding code into your R script and run it. If all went well, R should now show the first six rows of the dataset in the console. 0.8.2 str() We frequently want to know something about the types of variables in a dataset. For example, if you want to run an analysis of variance (ANOVA), the independent variable(s) should be categorical. In R, these variables would be represented by a special type of variable called a factor. Before running our analysis, we should check if are data satisfy this requirement. We can use the str() function to get some information about the structure of an R object (str is an abbreviation of structure). To run the str() function, you only need to provide one argument: the name of the dataset. ## Inspect the structure of the dataset str(LifeSat) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 98 obs. of 8 variables: ## $ LifSat : num 13 18 19 24 24 24 30 33 33 33 ... ## $ age : num 75 75 72 72 70 73 72 72 68 73 ... ## $ educ : num 6 5 5 6 5 6 6 5 7 6 ... ## $ gender : num 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;value.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:2] &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;male&quot; &quot;female&quot; ## $ female : num 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 ... ## $ ChildSup: num 4 6 6 6 6 8 8 7 4 8 ... ## $ SpouSup : num 2 5 5 4 5 6 4 6 2 8 ... ## $ SES : num 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;value.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:3] &quot;3&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:3] &quot;high SES&quot; &quot;middle SES&quot; &quot;low SES&quot; ## - attr(*, &quot;variable.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:8] &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;Years of education&quot; &quot;&quot; ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:8] &quot;LifSat&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;educ&quot; &quot;gender&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;codepage&quot;)= int 1252 According to the output printed to the console, the LifeSat dataset is a data frame consisting of 98 observations of 8 variables. I.e., our dataset has 98 rows and 8 columns. We also get information about the contents of each column. For the fist column, we see $ LifSat : num 13 18 19 24 24 24 30 33 33 33 ... The LifSat variable is numeric (abbreviated as num). 13 is the value in the first row, 18 is the value in the second row, 19 is the value in the third row, and so on. 0.8.3 summary() We can get the descriptive statistics of the variables in a dataset with the summary() function. Again, we only need to provide one argument: the name of the dataset. summary(LifeSat) ## LifSat age educ gender ## Min. : 13.00 Min. :64.00 Min. : 4.000 Min. :1.000 ## 1st Qu.: 44.25 1st Qu.:68.25 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.:1.000 ## Median : 58.00 Median :70.00 Median : 6.000 Median :1.000 ## Mean : 57.86 Mean :70.26 Mean : 6.541 Mean :1.449 ## 3rd Qu.: 69.75 3rd Qu.:72.00 3rd Qu.: 7.000 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :100.00 Max. :75.00 Max. :12.000 Max. :2.000 ## female ChildSup SpouSup SES ## Min. :0.000 Min. : 3.000 Min. : 2.000 Min. :1.000 ## 1st Qu.:0.000 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.: 5.000 1st Qu.:1.000 ## Median :1.000 Median : 7.000 Median : 6.000 Median :2.000 ## Mean :0.551 Mean : 6.857 Mean : 6.061 Mean :1.918 ## 3rd Qu.:1.000 3rd Qu.: 8.000 3rd Qu.: 8.000 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :1.000 Max. :10.000 Max. :10.000 Max. :3.000 Run the above code and check the output in the console.

"],["tutorialPlotting.html", "0.9 Plotting data", " 0.9 Plotting data It is almost always a good idea to visualize your data before you dive into a full statistical analysis. For example, you may like to know something about the nature of the relationship between two specific variables, the distribution of some set of values, etc. In this section, we will create three basic plots of our data. When we create these plots, the figures will appear in the plots tab in the lower right quadrant of the RStudio window. 0.9.1 R packages and ggplot2 We will use the ggplot2 package for plotting. This package is not part of the Base R installation. So, you must install ggplot2 yourself (you should have already done so in Section 0.2.3). You only need to install an R package once. R packages are just small software programs, so they must be installed just like any other piece of software. After installing, the package is accessible on your computer but not yet available for use in your current R session. You must first load the package. You need to load the package every time you want to use it in a new R session. After loading, the package contents (i.e., functions, help files, datasets) are initialized in memory and ready to use in your current R session. Loading a package is more-or-less equivalent to ‘opening’ a software program by clicking on its desktop icon. Run the following code to load the ggplot2 package. library(ggplot2) 0.9.2 Histogram We can use a histogram to visualize how the values of a continuous variable are distributed. ## Use the &#39;LifeSat&#39; data to create the plot ## Use the &#39;LifeSat$LifSat&#39; variable to define the X-axis ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat)) + geom_histogram() # Create a histogram from the data/variable defined above 0.9.3 Boxplot A boxplot provides another useful visualization of a continuous variable’s distribution. We can also use boxplots to detect outliers. ## Same data/variable setup as above: ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat)) + geom_boxplot() # Create a boxplot 0.9.4 Scatterplot A scatterplot provides a visual representation of the relationship between two variables. Since we are now plotting two variables, we need to define a y variable in addition to thex variable specified in the previous examples. ## Add the &#39;age&#39; variable on the Y-axis: ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat, y = age)) + geom_point() # Create a scatterplot "],["manipulating-data.html", "0.10 Manipulating Data", " 0.10 Manipulating Data 0.10.1 Data types Recall the output of the str() function. One piece of information contained therein is the type of data stored in each column of our dataset. There a different abbreviations signifying different types of data. Abbreviation Type Description num Numeric All values are numbers (e.g., 1.02) chr Character All values are words log Logical Boolean flags: TRUE or FALSE factor Factor A special type of object with labels to represent the levels of a categorical variable 0.10.2 Factors Factors are a special type of data object that R uses to represent categorical variables. A factor is stored internally as a vector of integers where each group is represented by a different number. The groups also get descriptive labels. R knows that a factor is not numeric and will treat any factor as a nominal grouping variable for anlaysis. In the output from the str() function in 0.8.2, we see that the gender variable is stored as a numeric variable. You can confirm by running either of the following commands. is.numeric(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] TRUE class(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; The gender varible is a binary grouping variable, so it should be stored as a factor. To convert gender to a factor, we can use the factor() function. ## Convert &#39;gender&#39; to a factor: LifeSat$gender &lt;- factor(LifeSat$gender) ## Check the results: is.numeric(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] FALSE class(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; str(LifeSat$gender) ## Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;: 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 ... We now see that gender has been converted to a factor with the levels “1” and “2”. We don’t have to settle for meaningless numeric labels, though. We can assign meaningful value labels by providing an appropriate input for the labels argument. ## Create a factor with meaningful labels: LifeSat$gender &lt;- factor(LifeSat$gender, labels = c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;)) ## Check the results: str(LifeSat$gender) ## Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;: 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 ... 0.10.3 Subsetting: Extracting one variable When working with data frames, we can extract a single variable (i.e., column) from the data using the dollar sign operator, $. As shown in the example below. # Extract the &#39;LifSat&#39; variable from &#39;LifeSat&#39;: LifeSat$LifSat ## [1] 13 18 19 24 24 24 30 33 33 33 33 33 35 35 37 37 41 41 41 ## [20] 43 43 43 44 44 44 45 47 48 48 48 50 51 51 52 53 53 53 53 ## [39] 54 55 55 56 56 56 57 58 58 58 58 58 58 59 59 60 61 61 63 ## [58] 63 63 65 66 67 67 67 67 68 68 68 69 69 69 69 69 70 70 70 ## [77] 71 72 74 74 76 77 77 78 78 79 79 79 81 81 82 83 85 86 87 ## [96] 91 99 100 In the above code, we ask R to extract the column named LifSat from the data frame named LifeSat. The result will be returned as another special type of object: a vector. 0.10.4 Subsetting: Extracting rows and columns We can also extract rectangular subsets of a data frame using the following convention: my_data_frame[row_numbers, column_numbers]. ## Extract the first four rows of the first two columns: LifeSat[1:4, 1:2] By leaving either rows or columns empty, we get all rows or columns: ## Extract all rows of first two columns: LifeSat[ , 1:2] ## Extract all columns of first two rows: LifeSat[1:2, ] We can refer to the columns by name, too: LifeSat[1:2, c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;educ&quot;)] 0.10.5 Subsetting based on logical conditions We can also select rows or columns that satisfy logical conditions. In the following code, we select only the rows for which LifeSat$age is greater than 70. LifeSat[LifeSat$age &gt; 70, ] This approach works for any valid logical expression that will flag rows (or columns). Below, we select only the males and save the subset as a new object, LifeSat_male. LifeSat_male &lt;- LifeSat[LifeSat$gender == &quot;Male&quot;, ] str(LifeSat_male) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 44 obs. of 8 variables: ## $ LifSat : num 13 18 19 24 24 33 33 35 35 37 ... ## $ age : num 75 75 72 72 73 72 72 68 71 68 ... ## $ educ : num 6 5 5 6 6 5 12 6 4 7 ... ## $ gender : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... ## $ female : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ ChildSup: num 4 6 6 6 8 7 5 6 7 4 ... ## $ SpouSup : num 2 5 5 4 6 6 6 6 7 4 ... ## $ SES : num 3 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 ... ## - attr(*, &quot;variable.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:8] &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;Years of education&quot; &quot;&quot; ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:8] &quot;LifSat&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;educ&quot; &quot;gender&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;codepage&quot;)= int 1252 0.10.6 Changing cell values We can easily overwrite values in a dataset using the same type of subsetting operations shown above in combination with the assignment operator, &lt;-. The following code will extract the 5th entry in the LifSat variable. LifeSat[5, &quot;LifSat&quot;] ## [1] 24 Actually, it’s not really accurate to say that the above code “extracts” any value. The above command creates a new temporary object containing only the relevant value and prints the contents of that object to the console. All the subsetting examples above (other than the selection of all males) have done something similar. Rather than thinking about the [] or $ selection operators as ways of extracting pieces of a data object, it’s more appropriate to think about these operators as selecting, highlight, activating, nominating (or some other such concept) the referenced elements. Once the elements are so selected, we can also overwrite their original values. We only need to assign new values to the subset. To demonstrate, let’s overwrite the value selected above with 10. ## Overwrite the 5th &#39;LifSat&#39; value: LifeSat[5, &quot;LifSat&quot;] &lt;- 10 ## Check the result: LifeSat[5, &quot;LifSat&quot;] ## [1] 10 "],["getting-help.html", "0.11 Getting Help", " 0.11 Getting Help As you start to apply the techniques described in this guide, you will soon have questions that the guide does not answer. This section describes a few tips on how to get help answering these questions. Every function in R has documentation (i.e., a help file). To see this file in RStudio, select the name of the function in your script, and press F1, or run the command ? followed by the name of the function (e.g., ?aov). The second option works outside of RStudio, too. If you get stuck, start with Google. Typically, adding “R” to a search is enough to return relevant results (e.g., “exploratory factor analysis R”). Google is particularly useful for error messages. If you get an error message that you don’t understand, try googling it. Someone else has almost certainly been confused by the same message in the past, and there will be help somewhere on the web. If the error message isn’t in English, run Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = \"en\") and re-run the code that produced the error (you’re more likely to find help for English error messages.) If Google doesn’t help, try stackoverflow. Before posting your question, spend some time searching the site for an existing answer (active contributors really hate it when you ask a question that has already been answered on the site). Including [R] in your search string restricts your search to questions and answers that use R.

SKIP PAGES 322 - 327 Questions What are the differences between a “verbal model” and a “formal model”? As explained in the paragraph “A Brief Note on Statistical Models”, formal models are not the same as statistical models. Still, we can learn a lot from Smaldino’s approach. Write down three insights from this paper that you would like to apply to your statistical modeling during this course. Answers Q1: A verbal model can be non-specific about many things The level of analysis The definitions of its parts The relationships within the modeled system Verbal models can appear powerful and useful partly because they employ strategic ambiguity. Because verbal models are so vague, they can apparently explain many different phenomena, even contradictory ones (e.g., the Cubist chicken). A formal model, on the other hand, seeks to rigorously define its level of analysis, parts (variables), and relationships between these parts. Q2: You should define the level of analysis for your model You should clearly operationalize the parts (variables) and explicitly define the hypothesized relationships (causal, correlational, definitional) between these parts The act of formally defining our models is productive. We can test a well-defined model using data. We can discuss such a model among experts with relative consensus about what the model means, and we can improve it. These things are harder to do with vague verbal models. Every model imposes some violence upon reality. I.e., every model is wrong (but some are useful). Because a model is a simplification, by necessity, we leave out many factors. This simplification is a feature, not a bug. Models abstract away the uninteresting details (i.e., noise) of a phenomenon. Even models that are too simple to be interesting represent useful building-blocks to expand upon when creating more complex, interesting models. Data can be used to validate a model and to refine the model into a closer approximation of reality "],["formative-assessment.html", "1.3 Formative Assessment", " 1.3 Formative Assessment A formative assessment helps you judge your progress in the course and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material.

What is the age range (youngest and oldest child)? Hint: Use tidySEM::descriptives() Click for explanation As in the take home exercises, you can use the descriptives() function from the tidySEM package to describe the data: library(tidySEM) descriptives(sesam) 1.5.1.4 What is the average gain in knowledge of numbers? What is the standard deviation of this gain? Hints: You will need to compute the gain and save the change score as a new object. You can then use the base-R functions mean() and sd() to do the calculations. Click for explanation Create a new variable that represents the difference between pre- and post-test scores on knowledge of numbers: sesam$ndif &lt;- sesam$postnumb - sesam$prenumb Compute the mean and SD of the change score: mean(sesam$ndif) ## [1] 9.158333 sd(sesam$ndif) ## [1] 9.682401 1.5.1.5 Create an appropriate visualization of the gain scores you computed in 1.5.1.4. Justify your choice of visualization. Hint: Some applicable visualizations are explained in 0.9. Click for explanation library(ggplot2) ## Create an empty baseline plot object: p &lt;- ggplot(sesam, aes(x = ndif)) ## Add some appropriate geoms: p + geom_histogram() p + geom_density() p + geom_boxplot() 1.5.1.6 Create a visualization that provides information about the bivariate relationship between two of the variables. Justify your choice of visualization. Hint: Again, Section 0.9 may provide some useful insights. Click for explanation ## Create a scatterplot of the pre- and post-test number knowledge ggplot(sesam, aes(x = prenumb, y = postnumb)) + geom_point() 1.5.2 Part 2: Regression Analysis 1.5.2.1 Are there significant, bivariate associations between postnumb and the following variables? age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody Use Pearson correlations to answer this question. You do not need to check the assumptions here (though you would in real life). Hint: The base-R cor.test() function and the corr.test() function from the psych package will both conduct hypothesis tests for a correlation coefficients (the base-R cor() function only computes the coefficients). Click for explanation library(psych) ## Test the correlations using psych::corr.test(): corr.test( sesam[ , c(&quot;postnumb&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;prelet&quot;, &quot;prenumb&quot;, &quot;prerelat&quot;, &quot;peabody&quot;)] ) ## Call:corr.test(x = sesam[, c(&quot;postnumb&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;prelet&quot;, &quot;prenumb&quot;, ## &quot;prerelat&quot;, &quot;peabody&quot;)]) ## Correlation matrix ## postnumb age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody ## postnumb 1.00 0.34 0.50 0.68 0.54 0.52 ## age 0.34 1.00 0.33 0.43 0.44 0.29 ## prelet 0.50 0.33 1.00 0.72 0.47 0.40 ## prenumb 0.68 0.43 0.72 1.00 0.72 0.61 ## prerelat 0.54 0.44 0.47 0.72 1.00 0.56 ## peabody 0.52 0.29 0.40 0.61 0.56 1.00 ## Sample Size ## [1] 240 ## Probability values (Entries above the diagonal are adjusted for multiple tests.) ## postnumb age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody ## postnumb 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## age 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prelet 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prenumb 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prerelat 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## peabody 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## ## To see confidence intervals of the correlations, print with the short=FALSE option ## OR ## ## Test the correlations using multiple cor.test() calls: cor.test(sesam$postnumb, sesam$age) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sesam$postnumb and sesam$age ## t = 5.5972, df = 238, p-value = 5.979e-08 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2241066 0.4483253 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.3410578 cor.test(sesam$postnumb, sesam$prelet) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sesam$postnumb and sesam$prelet ## t = 8.9986, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4029239 0.5926632 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5038464 cor.test(sesam$postnumb, sesam$prenumb) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sesam$postnumb and sesam$prenumb ## t = 14.133, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.6002172 0.7389277 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.6755051 cor.test(sesam$postnumb, sesam$prerelat) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sesam$postnumb and sesam$prerelat ## t = 9.9857, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4475469 0.6268773 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5433818 cor.test(sesam$postnumb, sesam$peabody) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sesam$postnumb and sesam$peabody ## t = 9.395, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4212427 0.6067923 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.520128 1.5.2.2 Do age and prenumb explain a significant proportion of the variance in postnumb? What statistic did you use to justify your conclusion? Interpret the model fit. Hints: The lm() function (short for linear model) estimates linear regression models. The summary() function provides relevant summary statistics for the model. Click for explanation results &lt;- lm(postnumb ~ age + prenumb, data = sesam) summary(results) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = postnumb ~ age + prenumb, data = sesam) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -38.130 -6.456 -0.456 5.435 22.568 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

We use the F statistic for the overall test of model fit to support this conclusion. The variables age and prenumb together explain 45.9% of the variability in postnumb. 1.5.2.3 Write the null and alternative hypotheses for tested in 1.5.2.2. Click for explanation Since we are testing for explained variance, our hypotheses concern the \\(R^2\\). \\[ \\begin{align*} H_0: R^2 = 0\\\\ H_1: R^2 &gt; 0 \\end{align*} \\] Note that this is a directional hypotheses because the \\(R^2\\) cannot be negative. 1.5.2.4 Consider the path model below. How many regression coefficients are estimated in this model? How many variances are estimated? How many covariances are estimated? How many degrees of freedom does this model have? Hint: As you learned in Lecture 1, \\(df = N_{obs} – N_{par}\\). 1.5.2.5 Consider a multiple regression analysis with three continuous independent variables: scores on tests of language, history, and logic, and one continuous dependent variable: score on a math test. We want to know if scores on the language, history, and logic tests can predict the math test score. Sketch a path model that you could use to answer this question How many regression parameters are there? How many variances could you estimate? How many covariances could you estimate? How many degrees of freedom does this model have? 1.5.3 Part 3: ANOVA 1.5.3.1 Load the Drivers.sav data. # Read the data into a data frame named &#39;drivers&#39;: drivers &lt;- read.spss(&quot;Drivers.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE) In this section, we will use ANOVA to evaluate the following research question: Does talking on the phone interfere with people’s driving skills? These data come from an experiment. The condition variable represents the three experimental conditions: Hand-held phone Hands-free phone Control (no phone) We will use condition as the IV in our ANOVA models. The DV, RT, represents the participant’s reaction time (in milliseconds) during a driving simulation. ANOVA vs. Linear Regression As you may know, the mathematical model underlying ANOVA is just a linear regression model with nominal IVs. So, in terms of the underlying statistical models, there is no difference between ANOVA and regression; the differences lie in the focus of the analysis. ANOVA is really a type of statistical test wherein we are testing hypotheses about the effects of some set of nominal grouping factors on some continuous outcome. When doing an ANOVA, we usually don’t interact directly with the parameter estimates from the underlying model. Regression is a type of statistical model (i.e., a way to represent a univariate distribution with a conditional mean and fixed variance). When we do a regression analysis, we primarily focus on the estimated parameters of the underling linear model. When doing ANOVA in R, we estimate the model exactly as we would for linear regression; we simply summarize the results differently. 1.5.3.2 Perform the ANOVA to test the above research question. Hint: After estimating the model with lm(), you can use the anova() function to compute the sums-of-squares and significance tests for each factor in your model. Click for explanation ## Estimate the underlying model: results &lt;- lm(RT ~ condition, data = drivers) ## Summarize the model as a regression analysis: summary(results) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = RT ~ condition, data = drivers) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -317.50 -71.25 2.98 89.55 243.45 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

In particular, we should probably check at least three conditions: There are no overly influential cases The residual variance is homogonous across groups The residuals are normally distributed 1.5.3.3 Check for influential cases. Hint: You can use the cooks.distance() function to compute Cook’s Distance statistic for each observation. Observations with Cook’s D values substantially larger than, and qualitatively distinct from, the rest of the data may be overly influential. You can evaluate the relative sizes of the distances by making an index plot of the estimated distance statistics. Click for explanation ## Compute the Cook&#39;s distances: d &lt;- cooks.distance(results) ## Plot the distances: plot(d) In the figure above, we’re looking for any distances that clearly “stand out from the crowd”. None of the distances in the above figure look notable. We do not see evidence of influential observations. 1.5.3.4 Check the normality of the residuals. Hints: One of the best ways to check the normality of residuals is with a Normal QQplot. We can easily create a Normal QQ-Plot of the residuals by plotting the results object from 1.5.3.2. Click for explanation plot(results, 2) In the QQ-Plot created above, we want to see all of the points follow the diagonal, dashed line. Perfectly normal residuals will fall exactly along this line Deviations away from the line indicate devations from normality. The residuals in this figure look quite good. We only see very minor deviations from the idealized line. The residuals appear to be more-or-less normally distributed. 1.5.3.5 Check the homogeneity of the residual variances. Hints: A scale-location plot is one of the best ways to check the homogeneity of variances assumption. Plot an estimate of the residual variance against the predicted values Any trend indicates differences in residual variance between groups Plotting the results object from 1.5.3.2 will also produce a scale-location plot. Click for explanation plot(results, 3) The red line in this figure is a loess line which represents the trend of the plotted data. If this loess line is flat, there is no evidence of differences in the residual variances between groups. Trends in this line indicate violations of the homogeneity assumption. In this case, the line is pretty much flat and we have little-to-no evidence of heterogeneous residual variances. 1.5.3.6 Summarize your conclusions regarding the assumption. Are the assumptions satisfied? Can we trust the model results? Click for explanation There are no observations that stand out as particularly influential. Furthermore, we have no evidence of heterogeneous residual variances or substantial violations of normality for the residuals. Hence, the assumptions appear to be satisfied, and we can trust the conclusions of our analysis. 1.5.3.7 Use your results to answer the research question. Click for explanation anova(results) The effect of condition on RT was nonsignificant (\\(F[2, 57] = 3.07\\), \\(p = 0.054\\)). Therefore, based on these results, we do not have evidence for an effect of mobile phone usage on driving performance. 1.5.4 Part 4: ANCOVA We will now conduct an ANCOVA to assess the following research question. Are there differences in reaction times between the phone conditions after controlling for age? As with ANOVA, the statistical model underlying an ANCOVA is simply a linear regression model. The model for an ANCOVA, however, includes at least one continuous covariate in addition to the categorical IVs. Consequently, when we conduct ANCOVA in R, we again use the lm() function to estimate the model. 1.5.4.1 Estimate the ANCOVA model needed to test the above research question. Click for explanation ## Estimate the model: results &lt;- lm(RT ~ condition + age, data = drivers) ## Conduct the statistical tests: anova(results) ANCOVA and Interactions As you can see above, when we run an ANCOVA, we’re just estimating a multiple linear regression model. We call the analysis ANCOVA because we are interested in a specific hypothesis. Our substantive interest lies in the categorical IVs. The continuous covariates are uninteresting, nuisance variables that we are controlling for to get better estimates of the interesting treatment effects. One implication of this hypothesis is the absence of any interaction between the covariates and grouping factors. If the covariate moderates the treatment effect, the covariate has a direct impact on the substantively interesting group differences. Such a covariate is not a covariate; it’s a substantively integral feature of the model. If we want to report our analysis as an ANCOVA, we need to show that the covariate effects are equivalent in each group. In other words, there is no interaction between the grouping factors and the covariates. 1.5.4.2 Test for an interaction between age and condition in the model from 1.5.4.1. What is your conclusion? Can we report our analysis as an ANCOVA? Hint: You can include an interaction term in an R formulas ‘multiplying’ the two variable names using the * operator. Click for explanation ## Add the interaction between &#39;age&#39; and &#39;condition&#39; to the model: results_int &lt;- lm(RT ~ condition * age, data = drivers) ## Conduct the hypothesis tests. anova(results_int) The interaction between condition and age is not significant (\\(F[2, 54] = 1.07\\), \\(p = 0.349\\)). Therefore, the covariate effects should be more-or-less equivalent in each group, and we can report our analysis as an ANCOVA. 1.5.4.3 Answer the research from above question. If you did find a significant, partial effect of condition, do a post hoc comparison of pairwise mean differences to see which groups showed significantly different reaction times, after controlling for age. Use Tukey’s HSD correction for all pairwise comparisons to control the Type I error rate. Hints: You can conduct the appropriate post hoc test with the TukeyHSD() function. The TukeyHSD() function only works on models estimated using the aov() function (which is the same as lm() but summarizes the results in ANOVA style). To satisfy TukeyHSD(), you can either rerun your model with aov() or convert your results object to the correct format via aov(results). Click for explanation ## Check the hypothesis tests for the ANCOVA from above: anova(results) ## Run the post hoc comparisons: TukeyHSD(aov(results)) ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = results) ## ## $condition ## diff lwr upr p adj ## hands-free-hand-held -36.95 -118.5708 44.67082 0.5242511 ## control-hand-held -100.75 -182.3708 -19.12918 0.0119407 ## control-hands-free -63.80 -145.4208 17.82082 0.1533777 After controlling for age, phone usage significantly affects driving performance (\\(F[2, 56] = 4.52\\), \\(p = 0.015\\)). Specifically, the hand-held condition has a significant higher reaction time than the control condition. 1.5.5 Part 5: Back to Regression As we saw above, we can use ANOVA or ANCOVA to test hypotheses about differences between groups in some continuous outcome. AN(C)OVA is a type of statistical test, though, not a type of model. The statistical model underlying an AN(C)OVA is just a linear regression model. Since this class is about statistical modeling, it won’t do us much good to keep thinking in terms of statistical tests; we’re better off approaching these problems from a modeling perspective. We can just as easily make the inferences from above by working directly within a regression modeling framework. In this section, we will explore linear regression models with categorical predictors. 1.5.5.1 Load the Sesam2.sav data. # Read the data into an object called &#39;sesam2&#39;: sesam2 &lt;- read.spss(&quot;Sesam2.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE) 1.5.5.2 VIEWCAT is a nominal grouping variable, but it is represented as a numeric variable in the sesam2 data. Convert VIEWCAT into a factor. Make sure that VIEWCAT = 1 is the reference group. Hints: You can identify the reference group with the levels() or contrasts() functions. The reference group is the group labelled with the first level printed by levels(). When you run contrasts(), you will see a pattern matrix that defines a certain dummy coding scheme. The reference group is the group that has zeros in each column of this matrix. If you need to change the reference group, you can use the relevel() function. Click for explanation ## Convert &#39;VIEWCAT&#39; to a factor: sesam2$VIEWCAT &lt;- factor(sesam2$VIEWCAT) ## Check the reference group: levels(sesam2$VIEWCAT) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; contrasts(sesam2$VIEWCAT) ## 2 3 4 ## 1 0 0 0 ## 2 1 0 0 ## 3 0 1 0 ## 4 0 0 1 1.5.5.3 Estimate a multiple regression model wherein VIEWCAT predicts POSTNUMB. Summarize the model. Interpret the estimates.

Color the points according to the their VIEWCAT level. Save the plot object to a variable in your environment. Hint: You can map color to the levels of a variable on your dataset by assigning the variable names to the color argument of the aes() function in ggplot(). Click for explanation library(ggplot2) ## Add aes(..., color = VIEWCAT) to get different colors for each group: p &lt;- ggplot(sesam2, aes(x = AGE, y = POSTNUMB, color = VIEWCAT)) + geom_point() # Add points for scatterplot ## Print the plot stored as &#39;p&#39;: p We assigned the global color aesthetic to the VIEWCAT variable, so the points are colored based on their group. 1.5.5.5 Add linear regression lines for each group to the above scatterplot. Hints: You can add regression lines with ggplot2::geom_smooth() To get linear regression lines, set the argument method = \"lm\" To omit error envelopes, set the argument se = FALSE Click for explanation ## Add OLS best-fit lines: p + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) The global color aesthetic assignment from above carries through to any additional plot elements that we add, including the regression lines. So, we also get a separate regression line for each VIEWCAT group. 1.5.5.6 How would you interpret the pattern of regression lines above? Click for explanation All the lines show a positive slope, so post-test number recognition appears to increase along with increasing age. The lines are not parallel, though. So, VIEWCAT may be moderating the effect of AGE on POSTNUMB. Moderated Regression Based on the figure we just created, we may want to test for moderation in our regression model. To do so, we need to add an interaction between AGE and VIEWCAT. The VIEWCAT factor is represented by 3 in our model, though. So, when we interact AGE and VIEWCAT, we will create 3 interaction terms. To test the overall moderating influence of VIEWCAT, we need to conduct a multiparameter hypothesis test of all 3 interaction terms. One way that we can go about implementing such a test is through a hierarchical regression analysis entailing three steps: Estimate the additive model wherein we regress POSTNUMB onto AGE and VIEWCAT without any interaction. Estimate the moderated model by adding the interaction between AGE and VIEWCAT into the additive model. Conduct a \\(\\Delta R^2\\) test to compare the fit of the two models. 1.5.5.7 Conduct the hierarchical regression analysis described above. Does VIEWCAT significantly moderate the effect of AGE on POSTNUMB? Provide statistical justification for your conclusion.

Does this comparison offer any insight into the relation between regression and AN(C)OVA? Click for explanation anova(results_mod) anova(results_add, results_mod) When we run the anova() function on only the moderated regression model, we get ANCOVA-style tests like those we used in 1.5.4.2. The marginal test for the interaction between AGE and VIEWCAT in this ANCOVA-style result is identical to the model comparison test from 1.5.5.7. This comparison shows that the significance tests for marginal effects in an AN(C)OVA model can be equivalent to certain model comparison tests in a regression model. Indeed, although you cannot know this from only the examples explored here, any significance test in an AN(C)OVA can be reformulated as a comparison between two appropriately nested linear regression models.

"],["lecture-1.html", "2.1 Lecture", " 2.1 Lecture Download slides How do you know if you have measured the putative hypothetical construct that you intend to measure? The methods introduced in this lecture (namely, latent variables, factor analysis, and reliability analysis) can shed empirical light on this issue. In the social and behavioral sciences we’re often forced to measure key concepts indirectly. For example, we have no way of directly quantifying a person’s current level of depression, or their innate motivation, or their risk-aversion, or any of the other myriad psychological features that comprise the human mental state. In truth, we cannot really measure these hypothetical constructs at all, we must estimate latent representations thereof (though, psychometricians still use the language of physical measurement to describe this process). Furthermore, we can rarely estimate an adequate representation with only a single observed variable (e.g., question on a survey, score on a test, reading from a sensor). We generally need several observed variables to reliably represent a single hypothetical construct. For example, we cannot accurately determine someone’s IQ or socio-economic status based on their response to a single question; we need several questions that each tap into slightly different aspects of IQ or SES. Given multiple items measuring the same construct, we can use the methods discussed in this lecture (i.e., factor analysis and reliability analysis) to evaluate the quality of our measurement (i.e., how well we have estimated the underlying hypothetical construct). If we do well enough in this estimation task, we will be able to combine these estimated latent variables with the path analysis methods discussed in two weeks to produce the full structural equation models that we will cover at the end of this course.

Repairing Tom Swift’s electric factor analysis machine, Understanding Statistics 2(1) 13–43. Questions 1 What is a latent variable? Give an example of a latent variable. What is factor analysis, and what can you investigate using this method? In the introduction, Preacher and Maccallum describe a “little jiffy” method of doing factor analysis. Briefly describe this little jiffy—or bad practice—method. Briefly explain the key differences between Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and Exploratory Factor Analyses (EFA). What is the purpose of factor rotation? Answers 1 A latent variable is a variable (i.e. something that differs between research subjects or changes within the same subject over time) that we cannot observe directly. Rather, we infer the value of a latent variable by combining observed variables that each tap into different aspects of the latent variable. Almost all psychological, sociological, or cultural constructs are latent variables. Some common examples include IQ, personality, political or racial attitudes, mathematical or artistic ability, etc. (Exploratory) factor analysis is a statistical method for estimating the latent measurement structure that generates a set of measured variables. In other words, when doing EFA, we’re trying to estimate how many latent variables underlie a set of observed data and which observed items “belong to” which latent variable. The “little jiffy” method consists of the following steps: Run a PCA to extract factors Apply no subsequent rotation or the varimax rotation Retain all components with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 This approach results from running “factor analysis” with the SPSS defaults. In most situations, however, this setup won’t give a meaningful answer to the substantive research questions we’re investigating when doing EFA. The main difference between PCA and EFA comes down to how the observed variance is factored between the latent variables and the unique (residual) factors. PCA directly explains the observed variances. So, if you extract enough components, the latent variables will explain 100% of the observed variance. EFA allows each observed item to retain its own unique factor to quantify the item variance not explained by the latent variables. Unless you constrain the model, the variance explained by the latent factors should not reach 100% of the observed variance. Factor rotation entails applying linear transformations to “rotate” the factor axes (i.e., the geometric representations of the latent variables) through the data space to produce a so-called “simple structure” in which each observed item loads onto only one factor (to the extent that this is possible). There are two flavors of rotations: Orthogonal rotation: All latent factors are uncorrelated (i.e. the factor axes describe a 90 degree angle) Oblique rotation: The latent factors are allowed to correlate Reference 2 Kestilä, E. (2006). Is there demand for radical right populism in the Finnish electorate? Scandinavian Political Studies 29(3), 169–191. Questions 2 What is the research question that the author tries to answer? Briefly describe the characteristics of the Radical Right Parties (RRP) in Europe. What are the two main explanations of support for RRP upon which this paper focuses? Does the empirical part of the paper reflect the theoretical framework well? Why or why not? According to the author, is Finland very different from other European countries on the main dependent variables? What is the author’s conclusion (i.e., how does the author answer the research question)? Answers 2 Why is there no Radical Right Party in Finland? To explore this question, the author considers how similar the attitudes of the Finnish electorate about trust in politics and immigration are to other Western-European countries. Pages 175–177 provide the relevant information. Briefly: RRPs emphasize anti-immigrant attitudes and connect immigration to feelings of insecurity, spurring debates about crime. RRPs are anti-elitist, protest parties that often push for lower taxes while protecting the welfare state. RRPs represent the antitheses of green parties. RRPs represent the ‘losers’ of modernization and emphasize traditional moral values, social norms, the role of the family, and the importance of national culture. The anti-immigration issue and protest voting Of course, this conclusion is debatable, but I don’t think the empirical and theoretical aspects of the paper align very well. The way the key constructs are operationalized (i.e., via orthogonally rotated component scores) is not a very good way to get sensible estimates of the true hypothetical constructs. Furthermore, the idea of defining the outcome for the final regression analysis as the naive sum of the component scores casts considerable doubt on the validity of that analysis (in terms of the DV accurately representing its putative construct). No, Finland is very similar to other (Nordic) European countries. Anti-immigrant and anti-politics attitudes cannot explain why there is no RRP in Finland. The author finds reasons for the absence of such a link in history and the fact that politicians from mainstream political parties have caught the populist voters.

Click for explanation In keeping with conventions, we will treat ordinal Likert-type rating scales with five or more levels as continuous. Consequently, we need to convert these variables from factors to numeric vectors. We can convert a factor to a numeric variable using the as.numeric() function, but this function only operates on one variable at a time. To replicate the Kestilä (2006) analysis, we need to convert 37 variables. Thankfully, we can use apply functions to broadcast univariate operation across each column (or row) of a dataset. We are specifically interested in the lapply() function. The lapply() function applies some function to each element in a list (e.g., each column in a data frame). The variables we care about live in columns 7 to 44 of the ess dataset. In the following code, we apply the as.numeric() function to these columns and overwrite their original factor versions with the converted numeric data. ess[7:44] &lt;- lapply(ess[7:44], as.numeric) In addition to screening with summary statistics, we can also visualize the variables’ distributions. You have already created a few such visualizations for single variables. Now, we will use a few tricks to efficiently plot each of our target variables. The first step in this process will be to convert the interesting part of our data from “wide format” (one column per variable) into “long format” (one column of variable names, one column of data values). The pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package provides a convenient way to execute this conversion. 2.4.5 Use tidyr::pivot_longer() to create a long-formatted data frame from the target variables in ess (i.e., columns 7 to 44). Click for explanation ## Load the tidyr package: library(tidyr) ## Convert the target variables into a long-formatted data frame: ess_plot &lt;- pivot_longer(ess[7:44], colnames(ess)[7:44]) The next step in the process will be to plot the variables using ggplot(). To create one plot for each variable, we will use the facet_wrap() function to facet the plots on the ess_plot$name column (i.e., create a separate conditional plot for each unique value in ess_plot$name). 2.4.6 Use ggplot() with an appropriate geom (e.g., geom_histogram(), geom_density(), geom_boxplot()) and facet_wrap() to visualize each of the target variables. Hint: To implement the faceting, simply add facet_wrap(~ name, scales = \"free_x\") to the end of your ggplot() call. Click for explanation library(ggplot2) ggplot(ess_plot, aes(x = value)) + geom_histogram() + # Create a histogram facet_wrap(~ name, scales = &quot;free_x&quot;) # Facet on &#39;name&#39; Notice that the variables are actually discrete (i.e., each variable takes only a few integer values). However, most variables look relatively normal despite being categorical. So, it’s probably fine to analyze these variables as continuous. 2.4.7 Check the descriptives for the target variables again. Do you see any remaining issues? Click for explanation descriptives(ess[7:44]) No. Everything looks pretty much fine. Now, we’re ready to run the analyses and see if we can replicate the Kestilä (2006) results. 2.4.8 Run two principal component analyses (PCA): one for trust in politics, one for attitudes towards immigration. Use the principal() function from the psych package. Use exactly the same specifications as Kestilä (2006) concerning the estimation method, rotation, number of components extracted, etc. Hints: Remember that you can view the help file for psych::principal() by running ?psych::principal or, if the psych package already loaded, simply running ?principal. When you print the output from psych::principal(), you can use the cut option to hide any factor loadings smaller than a given threshold. You could consider hiding any loadings smaller than those reported by Kestilä (2006) to make the output easier to interpret.

PCA is a dimension reduction technique that distills the most salient information from a set of variables into a (smaller) set of component scores. Hence, PCA can be a good way of creating aggregate items (analogous to weighted scale scores) when the data are not collected with validated scales. Principal component scores are automatically generated when we run the PCA. If we want to use these scores in subsequent analyses (e.g., as predictors in a regression model), we usually add them to our dataset as additional columns. 2.4.9 Add the component scores produced by the analyses you ran above to the ess data frame. Give each component score an informative name, based on your interpretation of the factor loading matrix I.e., What hypothetical construct do you think each component represents given the items that load onto it? Hints: You can use the data.frame() function to join multiple objects into a single data frame. You can use the colnames() function to assign column names to a matrix or data frame. Click for explanation 1. Extract the component scores The object produced by psych::principal() is simply list, and the component scores are already stored therein. So, to extract the component scores, we simply use the $ operator to extract them. ## Save the component scores in stand-alone matrices: trust_scores &lt;- pca_trust$scores att_scores &lt;- pca_att$scores ## Inspect the result: head(trust_scores) ## RC3 RC2 RC1 ## 1 NA NA NA ## 4 0.09755193 -0.01552183 0.994954 ## 7 0.23069626 -1.53162604 -2.022642 ## 14 NA NA NA ## 17 -0.21112678 0.84370377 1.200007 ## 20 1.86596955 0.31083233 -1.062603 summary(trust_scores) ## RC3 RC2 RC1 ## Min. :-4.035 Min. :-3.706 Min. :-3.139 ## 1st Qu.:-0.527 1st Qu.:-0.652 1st Qu.:-0.649 ## Median : 0.155 Median : 0.094 Median : 0.092 ## Mean : 0.055 Mean : 0.015 Mean : 0.049 ## 3rd Qu.: 0.727 3rd Qu.: 0.742 3rd Qu.: 0.742 ## Max. : 3.302 Max. : 3.452 Max. : 3.539 ## NA&#39;s :4912 NA&#39;s :4912 NA&#39;s :4912 head(att_scores) ## RC2 RC1 RC5 RC3 RC4 ## 1 1.9920289 1.3140238 -0.8305392 -0.06329775 -0.08837693 ## 4 0.1708174 -1.2167781 -0.4974957 -0.23766146 0.67364069 ## 7 -0.3580985 0.3236336 -1.5094405 -0.53052720 -2.20637993 ## 14 NA NA NA NA NA ## 17 -0.1136716 -0.7869911 -1.4664715 -0.07112144 0.41078167 ## 20 -0.9188606 2.8264230 -0.3477484 -0.73788338 -1.32089442 summary(att_scores) ## RC2 RC1 RC5 RC3 ## Min. :-3.650 Min. :-3.909 Min. :-3.817 Min. :-2.730 ## 1st Qu.:-0.611 1st Qu.:-0.599 1st Qu.:-0.653 1st Qu.:-0.748 ## Median :-0.080 Median : 0.053 Median :-0.004 Median :-0.152 ## Mean :-0.007 Mean : 0.001 Mean : 0.023 Mean :-0.026 ## 3rd Qu.: 0.686 3rd Qu.: 0.644 3rd Qu.: 0.653 3rd Qu.: 0.620 ## Max. : 3.743 Max. : 4.495 Max. : 4.114 Max. : 3.869 ## NA&#39;s :5400 NA&#39;s :5400 NA&#39;s :5400 NA&#39;s :5400 ## RC4 ## Min. :-3.767 ## 1st Qu.:-0.682 ## Median : 0.045 ## Mean : 0.004 ## 3rd Qu.: 0.716 ## Max. : 3.248 ## NA&#39;s :5400 2.

Click for explanation Yes, more-or-less. Although the exact estimates differ somewhat, the general pattern of factor loadings in Kestilä (2006) matches what we found here. "],["in-class-exercises-1.html", "2.5 In-Class Exercises", " 2.5 In-Class Exercises In these exercises, we will continue with our re-analysis/replication of the Kestilä (2006) results. Rather than attempting a direct replication, we will now redo the analysis using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). 2.5.1 Load the ESSround1-b.csv dataset. These are the same data that you analyzed for the At-Home Exercises, but the processing/recoding that you should have done for those exercises has already been implemented. ess &lt;- read.csv(&quot;ESSround1-b.csv&quot;) 2.5.2 Kestilä (2006) claimed that running a PCA is a good way to test if the questions in the ESS measure attitudes towards immigration and trust in politics. Based on what you’ve learned from the readings and lectures, do you agree with this position? Click for information Hopefully not. PCA is not a method for estimating latent measurement structure; PCA is a dimension reduction technique that tries to summarize a set of data with a smaller set of component scores. If we really want to estimate the factor structure underlying a set of observed variables, we should use EFA. 2.5.3 Suppose you had to construct the trust in politics and attitude towards immigration scales described by Kestilä (2006) based on the theory and background information presented in that article. What type of analysis would you choose? What key factors would influence your decision? Click for information We are trying to estimate meaningful latent factors, so EFA would be an appropriate method. The theory presented by Kestilä (2006) did not hypothesize a particular number of factors, so we would need to use appropriate techniques to estimate the best number. In particular, combining information from: Scree plots Parallel analysis Substantive interpretability of the (rotated) factor loadings Since the factors are almost certainly correlated, we should apply an oblique rotation. We will now rerun the two PCAs that you conducted for the At-Home Exercises using EFA. We will estimate the EFA models using the psych::fa() function, but we need to know how many factors to extract. We could simply estimate a range of solutions and compare the results. We can restrict the range of plausible solutions and save some time by first checking/plotting the eigenvalues and running parallel analysis. 2.5.4 Estimate the number of latent factors underlying the Trust items based on the eigenvalues, the scree plot, and parallel analysis. How many factors are suggested by each method? Hint: You can create a scree plot by supplying the vector of eigenvalues to the qplot() function from the ggplot2 package and applying the geom_path() geometry. Click for explanation First, we’ll run a trivial EFA using the psych::fa() function to get eigenvalues. We don’t care about the factors yet, so we can extract a single factor. We also don’t care about interpretable solutions, so we don’t need rotation. ## Load the psych package: library(psych) ## Run a trivial EFA on the &#39;trust&#39; items efa_trust0 &lt;- fa(ess[7:19], nfactors = 1, rotate = &quot;none&quot;) We can check the eigenvalues to see what proportion of the observed variance is accounted for by each additional factor we may extract. round(efa_trust0$values, digits = 3) ## [1] 4.940 0.733 0.492 0.173 0.064 0.014 -0.066 -0.091 -0.195 -0.210 ## [11] -0.289 -0.307 -0.318 Since only one eigenvalue is greater than one, the so-called “Kaiser Criterion” would suggest extracting a single factor. The Kaiser Criterion is not a valid way to select the number of factors in EFA. So, we don’t want to rely on this information alone. We can still use the eigenvalues to help us with factor enumeration, though. One way to do so is by plotting the eigenvalues in a scree plot. We can easily create a scree plot by passing the eigenvalues to the qplot() function from the ggplot2 package and add apply the geom_path() geometry: library(ggplot2) qplot(y = efa_trust0$values) + geom_path() + ylab(&quot;Eigenvalues&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Factors&quot;) Although the scree plot provides useful information, we need to interpret that information subjectively, and the conclusions are sometimes ambiguous. In this case, the plot seems to suggest either one or three components, depending on where we consider the “elbow” to lie. As recommended in the lecture, we can also use “parallel analysis” (Horn, 1965) to provide more quantified information about the number of factors. We’ll use the psych::fa.parallel() function to implement parallel analysis. Parallel analysis relies on randomly simulated/permuted data, so we should set a seed to make sure our results are reproducible. We can set the fa = \"fa\" option to get only the results for EFA. ## Set the random number seed: set.seed(235711) ## Run the parallel analysis: pa_trust &lt;- fa.parallel(ess[7:19], fa = &quot;fa&quot;) ## Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 6 and the number of components = NA The results of the parallel analysis suggest 6 factors. If you’ve been paying close attention, you may have noticed that we need to compute the eigenvalues from the original data to run parallel analysis. Hence, we don’t actually need to run a separate EFA to estimate the eigenvalues. ## View the eigenvalues estimated during the parallel analysis: pa_trust$fa.values ## [1] 4.93985031 0.73335474 0.49174655 0.17294854 0.06372444 0.01363969 ## [7] -0.06605432 -0.09109183 -0.19535125 -0.20991379 -0.28855561 -0.30662420 ## [13] -0.31782296 ## Compare to the version from the EFA: pa_trust$fa.values - efa_trust0$values ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Recreate the scree plot from above: qplot(y = pa_trust$fa.values) + geom_path() + ylab(&quot;Eigenvalues&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Factors&quot;) The different criteria disagree on how many factors we should extract, but we have narrowed the range. Based on the scree plot and parallel analysis, we should consider solutions for 3 to 6 factors. We need to examine the factor loadings to see which solution makes the most substantive sense. 2.5.5 Do the same analysis for the attitudes toward immigration items. Click for explanation This time, we’ll start by running the parallel analysis and get the eigenvalues from the object returned by psych::fa.parallel(). ## Set the seed: set.seed(235711) ## Run parallel analysis on the &#39;attitudes&#39; items: pa_att &lt;- fa.parallel(ess[20:44]) ## Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 7 and the number of components = 5 ## Check the eigenvalues: round(pa_att$fa.values, digits = 3) ## [1] 7.841 1.474 0.748 0.534 0.327 0.152 0.123 0.025 -0.033 -0.064 ## [11] -0.081 -0.098 -0.121 -0.137 -0.145 -0.179 -0.196 -0.204 -0.214 -0.222 ## [21] -0.246 -0.253 -0.331 -0.425 -0.432 ## Create a scree plot: qplot(y = pa_att$fa.values) + geom_path() + ylab(&quot;Eigenvalues&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Factors&quot;) For the attitudes toward immigration analysis, the results are even more ambiguous than they were for the trust items. The Kaiser Criterion suggests 2 factors The scree plot is hopelessly ambiguous At least 3 factors? No more than 9 factors? Parallel analysis suggests 7 factors Based on the scree plot and parallel analysis, it seems reasonable to consider solutions for 3 to 7 factors. Again, we need to check the substantive interpretation to choose the most reasonable solution. To evaluate the substantive interpretability of the different solutions, we need to estimate the full EFA models for each candidate number of factors. We then compare the factor loadings across solutions to see which set of loading define the most reasonable set of latent variables. 2.5.6 For the trust items, estimate the EFA models for each plausible number of components that you identified above. Use the psych::fa() function to estimate the models. You will need to specify a few key options. The data (including only the variables you want to analyze) The number of factors that you want to extract The rotation method The estimation method The method of estimating factor scores Hint: You can save yourself a lot of typing/copy-pasting (and the attendant chances of errors) by using a for() loop to iterate through numbers of factors. Click for explanation ## Define an empty list to hold all of our fitted EFA objects: efa_trust &lt;- list() ## Loop through the interesting numbers of factors and estimate an EFA for each: for(i in 3:6) efa_trust[[i - 2]] &lt;- fa(ess[7:19], nfactors = i, # Number of factors = Loop index rotate = &quot;promax&quot;, # Oblique rotation scores = &quot;Bartlett&quot;) # Estimate factor scores with WLS 2.5.7 Repeat the above analysis for the attitudes items.

The factor loadings matrix indicates how strongly each latent factor (columns) associates with the observed items (rows). We can interpret these factor loadings in the same way that we would interpret regression coefficients (indeed, a factor analytic model can be viewed as a multivariate regression model wherein the latent factors are the predictors and the observed items are the outcomes). A higher factor loading indicates a stronger association between the item and factor linked by that loading. Items with high factor loadings are “good” indicators of the respective factors. Items with only very low loadings do not provide much information about any factor. You may want to exclude such items from your analysis. Note that the size of the factor loadings depends on the number of factors. So, you should only consider excluding an observed item after you have chosen the number of latent factors. When we print the loading matrix, we see additional information printed below the factor loadings. Proportion Var: What proportion of the items’ variance is explained by each of the factors. Cumulative Var: How much variance the factors explain, in total. If you estimated as many factors as items, then the Cumulative Var for the final factor would be 1.00 (i.e., 100%). 2.5.9 Compare the factor loading matrices from the models estimated from the Attitudes items, and select the best solution.

So, now it’s time to replicate those analyses. 2.5.11 Repeat the Kestilä (2006) between-country comparison using the factor scores you created in 2.5.10 and an appropriate statistical test. Click for explanation Here, we’ll only demonstrate a possible approach to analyzing one of the Trust dimensions. We can use an ANOVA to test whether the countries differ in average levels of Trust in Institutions (as quantified by the relevant factor score). out &lt;- aov(trust_inst ~ cntry, data = ess) summary(out) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## cntry 8 4730 591.2 637.3 &lt;2e-16 *** ## Residuals 14769 13700 0.9 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## 3409 observations deleted due to missingness According to the omnibus F-test, average levels of Trust in Institutions significantly differ between countries, but this test cannot tell us between which countries the differences lie. One way to test for differences between the individual countries would be a post hoc test of all pairwise comparisons. Since we’ll be doing 45 tests, we need to apply a correction for repeated testing. Below, we use Tukey’s HSD correction.

Before we can replicate this part of the analysis, we need to subset the data to only the Finnish cases. 2.5.12 Create a new data frame that contains only the Finnish cases from ess. Hint: You can use logical indexing based on the cntry variable. Click for explanation ess_finland &lt;- ess[ess$cntry == &quot;Finland&quot;, ] We still have one more step before we can estimate any models. We must prepare our variables for analysis. Our dependent variables will be the factor scores generated above. So, we do not need to apply any further processing. We have not yet used any of the independent variables, though. So, we should inspect those variables to see if they require any processing. In the ess data, the relevant variables have the following names: gndr yrbrn eduyrs polintr lrscale 2.5.13 Inspect the independent variables listed above. Click for explanation library(tidySEM) descriptives(ess_finland[c(&quot;gndr&quot;, &quot;yrbrn&quot;, &quot;eduyrs&quot;, &quot;polintr&quot;, &quot;lrscale&quot;)]) It looks like we still need some recoding. 1. Age The data contain the participants’ years of birth instead of their age, but Kestilä analyzed age. Fortunately, we know that the data were collected in 2002, so we can simply subtract each participant’s value of yrbrn from the 2002 to compute their age. ess_finland$age &lt;- 2002 - ess_finland$yrbrn 2. Political Interest &amp; Political Orientation The variables polintr and lrscale are represented as character vectors. If we analyze these variables as they are, R will convert the character vectors to factors and make dummy codes for each distinct value; we definitely don’t want that. We need to convert polintr and lrscale to numeric vectors, but we cannot naively apply the as.numeric() function, because R doesn’t know how to convert a word into a number (or, at least, not how we want the operation to be done). There are many ways that we could go about this conversion, but the recode() function from the dplyr package is particularly useful for arbitrary recoding tasks such as we have here. Kestilä (2006) dichotomized polintr by combining the lowest two and highest two categories. So, we don’t actually want to convert the polint variable into a numeric, Likert-type variable. We want polint to be a binary factor. The recode_factor() function from dplyr() will automatically convert our result into a factor. ## Load the dplyr package: library(dplyr) ## Recode the four character values into two factor levels: ess_finland$polintr_bin &lt;- recode_factor(ess_finland$polintr, &quot;Not at all interested&quot; = &quot;Low Interest&quot;, &quot;Hardly interested&quot; = &quot;Low Interest&quot;, &quot;Quite interested&quot; = &quot;High Interest&quot;, &quot;Very interested&quot; = &quot;High Interest&quot;) ## Check the conversion: table(old = ess_finland$polintr, new = ess_finland$polintr_bin) ## new ## old Low Interest High Interest ## Hardly interested 842 0 ## Not at all interested 228 0 ## Quite interested 0 785 ## Very interested 0 144 For political orientation, only the two extreme values of the scale are labeled as text. So, we only need to recode those two levels. Since we’re only replacing two of the 11 values, we’ll need to provide a value for the .default argument in dplyr::recode(). ## Recode the extreme levels: tmp &lt;- recode(ess_finland$lrscale, &quot;Left&quot; = 0, &quot;Right&quot; = 10, .default = as.numeric(ess_finland$lrscale) ) ## Check the conversion: table(old = ess_finland$lrscale, new = tmp) ## new ## old 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## 1 0 25 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 0 0 62 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 3 0 0 0 148 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 4 0 0 0 0 183 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 0 0 0 0 0 599 0 0 0 0 0 ## 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 199 0 0 0 0 ## 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 296 0 0 0 ## 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 217 0 0 ## 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 79 0 ## Left 24 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Right 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 59 ## Overwrite the old variable: ess_finland$lrscale &lt;- tmp 3.

Creating a single aggregate score by summing the individual component scores is a pretty silly thing to do, though. So, we won’t reproduce that aspect of the analysis. 2.5.14 Run a series of multiple linear regression analyses with the factor scores you created in 2.5.10 as the dependent variables and the same predictors used by Kestilä (2006).

One of the most common applications of EFA is scale development. Given a pool of items without a known factor structure, we try to estimate the underlying latent factors that define the (sub)scales represented by our items. In such applications, we use the factor loading matrix for our optimal solution to make “bright-line” assignments of items to putative factors according to the simple structure represented by the estimated factor loading matrix. In other words, we disregard small factor loadings and assign observed items to only the single latent factor upon which they load most strongly. We then hypothesize that those items are true indicators of that latent factor. We can use confirmatory factor analysis (which you will learn about next week) to test rigorously this hypothesis, but we can already get started by estimating the internal consistency (a type of reliability) of the hypothesized subscales. 2.5.15 Estimate the internal consistency of the three Trust subscales and five Attitudes subscales implied by your EFA solutions from above. Use Cronbach’s Alpha to quantify internal consistency. Use the alpha() function from the psych() package to conduct the analysis. Run your analysis on the full ess dataset, not the Finnish subset. Are the subscales implied by your EFA reliable, in the sense of good internal consistency? Note that \\(\\alpha &gt; 0.7\\) is generally considered acceptable, and \\(\\alpha &gt; 0.8\\) is usually considered good. Click for explanation Let’s estimate the reliability of the Satisfaction subscale from the Trust analysis. According to our EFA, the Satisfaction subscale should be indicated by the following five variables: stfeco stfgov stfdem stfedu stfhlth To estimate the internal consistency of this subscale, we simply provide a data frame containing only the subscale data to the alpha() function. ## Define a vector of subscale item names: (targets &lt;- paste0(&quot;stf&quot;, c(&quot;eco&quot;, &quot;gov&quot;, &quot;dem&quot;, &quot;edu&quot;, &quot;hlth&quot;))) ## [1] &quot;stfeco&quot; &quot;stfgov&quot; &quot;stfdem&quot; &quot;stfedu&quot; &quot;stfhlth&quot; ## Run the reliability analysis on the subscale data: (out &lt;- psych::alpha(ess[targets])) ## ## Reliability analysis ## Call: psych::alpha(x = ess[targets]) ## ## raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd median_r ## 0.79 0.79 0.77 0.44 3.9 0.0024 6.4 1.7 0.41 ## ## 95% confidence boundaries ## lower alpha upper ## Feldt 0.79 0.79 0.8 ## Duhachek 0.79 0.79 0.8 ## ## Reliability if an item is dropped: ## raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N alpha se var.r med.r ## stfeco 0.74 0.74 0.70 0.42 2.9 0.0032 0.0067 0.39 ## stfgov 0.74 0.74 0.69 0.42 2.9 0.0031 0.0031 0.41 ## stfdem 0.75 0.75 0.71 0.43 3.0 0.0030 0.0074 0.41 ## stfedu 0.76 0.76 0.72 0.45 3.2 0.0029 0.0103 0.43 ## stfhlth 0.78 0.78 0.73 0.47 3.5 0.0027 0.0063 0.45 ## ## Item statistics ## n raw.r std.r r.cor r.drop mean sd ## stfeco 17728 0.78 0.77 0.70 0.62 6.1 2.3 ## stfgov 17621 0.77 0.77 0.70 0.61 5.5 2.3 ## stfdem 17624 0.75 0.75 0.66 0.58 6.8 2.2 ## stfedu 17380 0.73 0.73 0.62 0.55 7.0 2.3 ## stfhlth 17981 0.70 0.69 0.57 0.50 6.8 2.3 The raw_alpha value is the estimate of Cronbach’s Alpha. In this case \\(\\alpha = 0.795\\), so the subscale is pretty reliable. The table labeled “Reliability if an item is dropped” shows what Cronbach’s Alpha would be if each item were excluded from the scale. If this value is notably higher than the raw_alpha value, it could indicate a bad item. Note that reliability is only one aspect of scale quality, though. So, you shouldn’t throw out items just because they perform poorly in reliability analysis.

"],["lecture-2.html", "3.1 Lecture", " 3.1 Lecture Download slides Often, we work with scales that have a validated or hypothesized factor structure. In the former case, the scale structure has been validated through previous psychometric studies. In the latter case, we may have conducted an EFA to estimate the factor structure on prior data, or theory/intuition may suggest a plausible structure. Regardless of how we come to expect a given factor structure, such situations represent confirmatory modeling problems, because we are attempting to empirically confirm an a priori expectation. Hence, exploratory methods like EFA are not appropriate, and we should employ confirmatory modeling techniques. This week we consider one such technique: confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). As the name suggests, CFA is related to the EFA methods we discussed last week in that both methods are flavors of factor analysis. However, the two methods address fundamentally different research questions. Rather than attempting to estimate an unknown factor structure (as in EFA), we now want to compare a hypothesized measurement model (i.e., factor structure) to observed data in order to evaluate the model’s plausibility.

Factor analytic models: Viewing the structure of an assessment instrument from three perspectives, Journal of Personality Assessment, 85(1), 17–32. Questions What are the main differences between exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)? In which circumstances should a researcher use EFA, and in which should they use CFA? What are the five main limitations of EFA that CFA overcomes? In which circumstances can a second order CFA model be useful? Consider the following four techniques: PCA, EFA, CFA, second order CFA. For each of the following three research situations, which of the above techniques would you use and why? A researcher has developed a new questionnaire that should measure personality and wants to know how many factors underlie the items in their new measure. A researcher is modeling data collected with a seven-item scale that has been used since the 1960s to measure authoritarianism. A researcher has recorded highest completed level of education, years of education, and highest level of education attempted for all respondents in a survey. The researcher wants to include some operationalization of the concept of ‘education’ in their model but is unsure of which observed variable to use. Answers “EFA is primarily a data-driven approach, whereas CFA is theoretically grounded.” (p. 17) “EFA is most appropriately used when links between the observed variables and their underlying factors are unknown or uncertain…One logical application of EFA would be in the development of a new assessment measure…In contrast, CFA is appropriately used when the researcher has some knowledge of the underlying latent variable structure. Based on theory…he or she postulates relations between the observed measures and the underlying factors a priori, and then tests this hypothesized structure statistically.” (p. 17) From page 18: In EFA, all common factors are either uncorrelated (orthogonal) or correlated (oblique). In CFA, arbitrary latent covariance structures can be specified by the researcher In EFA, all observed variables are influenced by all latent variables. In CFA, each observed variable is explained by only the latent variables (usually only one) specified by the researcher. In EFA, the unique factors are uncorrelated. In CFA, theoretically interesting residual correlations can be estimated between unique factors. In EFA, we very limited options when it comes to testing model fit. In CFA, testing model fit is a fundamental part of the analysis that is facilitated by a wide array of statistics and tools. In EFA, you cannot test whether factor structures and/or loadings are the same across groups. In CFA we can easily do so via multiple group modeling and measurement invariance testing. When the model contains multiple latent factors (ideally, more than two, for model identification) which can be explained by some common latent construct. Although several different approaches could be justified, the following seem like the most sensible: EFA: The factor structure is unknown and the researcher’s goal is to estimate this unknown factor structure. CFA: The factor structure is well-established. The researcher can use CFA quantify a latent authoritarianism variable for their model. CFA: The researcher doesn’t need to choose one variable from their three options. They can define a latent variable using all three items as indicators, and use that latent variable in subsequent analysis.

FALSE TRUE "],["at-home-exercises-2.html", "3.4 At-Home Exercises", " 3.4 At-Home Exercises Last week, you used PCA and EFA to replicate the results of Kestilä (2006). In this week’s In-Class Exercises, you will revisit the Kestilä (2006) analysis one more time, now using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In this course, we will use the R-package lavaan to fit CFA models (as well as the path models and structural equation models you’ll learn about in the coming weeks). Before you can jump into fitting a CFA to the Kestilä (2006) data, however, you need to learn the basics of working with lavaan. To prepare for the In-Class Exercises, work your way through this introduction to lavaan (part of which originates from the official lavaan tutorial). 3.4.1 To get started with lavaan, complete the following two chapters from the official lavaan tutorial: Installing lavaan Lavaan syntax You only need to read this one Now, we’ll demonstrate the basic lavaan workflow by estimating a linear regression model using observed variables. We will analyze data from Hamilton (1990) which quantify several attributes of 21 states in the US. We will use three of these variables in this tutorial: SAT: Average SAT score Income: Per capita income expressed in $1000 units Education: Median education for residents 25 years of age or older The data are available in either CSV or XLSX format via the Hamilton.csv or Hamilton.xlsx files, respectively. 3.4.2 Load the Hamilton (1990) data. Hints: Use the read.csv() function to load the data from CSV. Use the readxl::read_excel() function to load the data from XLSX. Both files contain the same data; you only need to load one version. Click for explanation ## Load the readxl library: library(readxl) ## Read the first sheet from &#39;Hamilton.xlsx&#39; into a data frame called &#39;hamilton&#39; hamilton &lt;- read_excel(&quot;Hamilton.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 1) ## OR ## ## Read the data from &#39;Hamilton.csv&#39; into a data frame called &#39;hamilton&#39; hamilton &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Hamilton.csv&quot;) The following path diagram shows the model we will fit to these data. This diagram represents a linear regression wherein Education and Income predict SAT. Furthermore, Education and Income are modeled as correlated random variables. As with any sensible model, Education and Income will not perfectly explain SAT (if this claim doesn’t make sense, think back to our discussions of model complexity and the strengths of parsimonious formal models in Week 1). Consequently, the variable Other represents the residual of SAT (i.e., all aspects of SAT that are not, linearly, related to Education or Income). Although not related to the mechanics of using lavaan, you may find the following equivalencies interesting. The regression model we’re considering here is actually a simple example of a path model such as those we’ll start with in Week 5 of this course. The Other factor shown in the diagram is equivalent to the residual term in a linear regression model. The Other factor is also equivalent to the unique factor or uniqueness for an observed indicator in an EFA or CFA model. 3.4.3 Based on what you learning from the lavaan tutorial, write out the lavaan model syntax for the model represented by the path diagram above. Write the syntax as a character string. Save this string as an object in your environment. Click for explanation mod &lt;- &#39; SAT ~ Income + Education Income ~~ Education &#39; This syntax specifies two regression slopes and one covariance. However, our specification also implies three variances which lavaan will automatically estimate. The residual variance of SAT The variance of Income The variance of Education Note that in the path diagram, all three variables have arrows pointing toward them. Hence, all three variables are random, which means we must model their variances. If we had not correlated Income and Education, we could have modeled them as fixed predictors and not estimated their variance. SAT is the DV in our model, so it must be random, and we must estimate its (residual) variance. If we wanted to fully explicate all paths in terms of lavaan syntax, we could do so as follows. mod &lt;- &#39; SAT ~ Income + Education Income ~~ Education SAT ~~ SAT Income ~~ Income Education ~~ Education &#39; In lavaan, we fit structural models (i.e., models with directional, causal relations) using the sem() function. We will use the sem() function to fit the model you specified in 3.4.3 to the Hamilton data. 3.4.4 Consult the documentation for lavaan::sem() to learn what you must do to estimate your model.

The SRMR looks good, but one good looking fit statistic is not enough. The RMSEA, TLI, and CFI are all in the “unacceptable” range. The \\(\\chi^2\\) is highly significant, but we don’t care. The cfa() function is just a wrapper for the lavaan() function with several options set at the defaults you would want for a standard CFA. By default: All latent variances and covariances are freely estimated (due to the argument auto.cov.lv.x = TRUE) The model is identified by fixing the first factor loading of each factor to 1 (due to the argument auto.fix.first = TRUE) To see a full list of the (many) options you can specify to tweak the behavior of lavaan estimation functions run ?lavOptions. Now, we will consider a couple of alternative factor structures for the Trust in Politics CFA. First, we will go extremely simple by estimating a one-factor model wherein all Trust items are explained by a single latent variable. 3.5.4 Define the lavaan model syntax for a one-factor model of the Trust items.

A second order CFA model is another way of representing the latent structure underlying a set of items. As you read in Byrne (2005), however, the second order CFA is only appropriate in certain circumstances. 3.5.6 Given the CFA results above, would a second order CFA be appropriate for the Trust data? Why or why not? Click for explanation Yes, a second order CFA model is a theoretically appropriate representation of the Trust items. The first order latent variables in the three-factor model are all significantly correlated. The first order latent variables in the three-factor model seem to tap different aspects of some single underlying construct. 3.5.7 Define the lavaan model syntax for a second-order CFA model of the Trust items. Use the three factors defined in 3.5.2 as the first order factors. Click for explanation To define the second order factor, we use the same syntactic conventions that we employ to define a first order factor. The only differences is that the “indicators” of the second order factor (i.e., the variables listed on the RHS of the =~ operator) are previously defined first order latent variables. mod_2nd &lt;- &#39; politicians =~ pltcare + pltinvt + trstplt satisfaction =~ stfeco + stfgov + stfdem + stfedu + stfhlth institutions =~ trstlgl + trstplc + trstun + trstprl trust =~ politicians + satisfaction + institutions &#39; 3.5.8 Estimate the second order CFA model, and summarize the results.

We also see that the degrees of freedom are identical between the two models. Hence, the two models have equal complexity. This result taps into a critical idea in statistical modeling, namely, model equivalency. It turns out the two models we’re comparing here are equivalent in the sense that they are statistically indistinguishable representations of the data. Since this is a very important idea, I want to spend some time discussing it in person. So, spend some time between now and the next lecture session thinking about the implications of this model equivalence. Specifically, consider the following questions: What do we mean when we say that these two models are equivalent? How is it possible for these two models to be equivalent when one contains an additional latent variable? Why are the degrees of freedom equal for these two models? Why are the fit statistics equal for these two models? How can we go about picking the “better” of these two models? We’ll take some time to discuss these ideas in the next lecture session. The above represents the extent to which we will use CFA to replicate the EFA/PCA components of the Kastelä (2006) analysis. We will now use the latent variables defined above to revisit the regression analysis from Kastelä (2006). Note that we will now be specifying regression models involving latent variables, so this is actually your first taste of full structural equation modeling (SEM). Enjoy! Unfortunately, we need to do a little data processing before we can fit the regression model. At the moment, lavaan will not automatically convert a factor variable into dummy codes. So, we need to create explicit dummy codes for the two factors we’ll use as predictors in our regression analysis: sex and political orientation. 3.5.9 Convert the sex and political interest factors into dummy codes. Click for explanation In R, we have several ways of converting a factor into an appropriate set of dummy codes. We could use the dplyr::recode() function as we did last week. We can use the model.matrix() function to define a design matrix based on the inherent contrast attribute of the factor. Missing data will cause problems here. We can us as.numeric() to revert the factor to its underlying numeric representation {Male = 1, Female = 2} and use arithmetic to convert {1, 2} \\(\\rightarrow\\) {0, 1}. When our factor only has two levels, though, the ifelse() function is the simplest way. ## Create a dummy code by broadcasting a logical test on the factor levels: ess$female &lt;- ifelse(ess$sex == &quot;Female&quot;, 1, 0) ## The same for political orientation: ess$hi_pol_interest &lt;- ifelse(ess$polintr_bin == &quot;High Interest&quot;, 1, 0) ## Check the results: with(ess, table(dummy = female, factor = sex)) ## factor ## dummy Female Male ## 0 0 8841 ## 1 9309 0 with(ess, table(dummy = hi_pol_interest, factor = polintr_bin)) ## factor ## dummy Low Interest High Interest ## 0 8099 0 ## 1 0 10042 3.5.10 Finally, subset the data to only Finnish participants. Click for explanation ess_fin &lt;- ess[ess$cntry == &quot;Finland&quot;, ] We are now ready to estimate our latent regression model. Specifically, we want to implement the following regression as an SEM in lavaan. \\[ Y_{trust\\_inst} = \\beta_1 X_{age} + \\beta_2 X_{female} + \\beta_3 X_{edu\\_years} + \\beta_4 X_{hi\\_pol\\_interest} + \\beta_5 X_{lrscale} + \\varepsilon_Y \\] 3.5.11 Define the lavaan model syntax for the regression shown above. Use the definition of the institutions factor from 3.5.2 to define the DV. Hint: You can simply copy the line of syntax that defines the latent factor and add a line to define the latent regression model. Click for explanation mod_sem &lt;- &#39; ## Define the latent DV: institutions =~ trstlgl + trstplc + trstun ## Specify the structural relations: institutions ~ female + age + eduyrs + hi_pol_interest + lrscale &#39; 3.5.12 Estimate the SEM, and summarize the results. Fit the model to the processed Finnish subsample from above. Estimate the model using lavaan::sem(). Use the default settings in the sem() function. Request the standardized parameter estimates with the summary. Request the \\(R^2\\) estimates with the summary by supplying the rsquare = TRUE argument to summary().

Researchers often have theories about possible causal processes linking multiple variables. Mediation is a particularly important example of such a process in which in an input variable, X, influences the outcome, Y, through an intermediary variable, M (the mediator). For instance, psychotherapy (X), may affect thoughts (M), which in turn affects mood (Y). We can investigate mediation via a specific sequence of linear regression equations, but path modeling will make our lives much easier. We can use path models to simultaneously estimate multiple related regression equations. So, mediation analysis is an ideal application of path modeling. In this lecture, we consider both approaches and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. "],["reading-3.html", "4.2 Reading", " 4.2 Reading Reference Baron, R. M. &amp; Kenny, D. A. (1986).
