[["index.html", "Theory Construction and Statistical Modeling Course Information", " Theory Construction and Statistical Modeling Kyle M. Lang Last updated: 2023-10-02 Course Information In order to test a theory, we must express the theory as a statistical model and then test this model on quantitative (numeric) data. In this course we will use datasets from different disciplines within the social sciences (educational sciences, psychology, and sociology) to explain and illustrate theories and practices that are used in all social science disciplines to statistically model social science theories. This course uses existing tutorial datasets to practice the process of translating verbal theories into testable statistical models. If you are interested in the methods of acquiring high quality data to test your own theory, we recommend following the course Conducting a Survey which is taught from November to January.

After completing the course, you will be able to: Translate a verbal theory into a conceptual model, and translate a conceptual model into a statistical model. Independently analyze data using the free, open-source statistical software R. Apply a latent variable model to a real-life problem wherein the observed variables are only indirect indicators of an unobserved construct. Use a path model to represent the hypothesized causal relations among several variables, including relationships such as mediation and moderation. Explain to a fellow student how structural equation modeling combines latent variable models with path models and the benefits of doing so. Reflect critically on the decisions involved in defining and estimating structural equation models.

"],["elaboration-tips.html", "Elaboration &amp; Tips", " Elaboration &amp; Tips Theoretical Model &amp; Research Question You need to provide some justification for your model and research question, but only enough to demonstrate that you’ve actually conceptualized and estimated a theoretically plausible statistical model (as opposed to randomly combining variables until lavaan returns a pretty picture). You have several ways to show that your model is plausible. Use common-sense arguments. Reference (a small number of) published papers. Replicate an existing model/research question. Don’t provide a rigorous literature-supported theoretical motivation. You don’t have the time to conduct a thorough literature review, and we don’t have the time to read such reviews when grading. Literature review is not one of the learning goals for this course, so you cannot get “bonus points” for an extensive literature review. You are free to test any plausible model that meets the size requirements. You can derive your own model/research question or you can replicate a published analysis. Model Specifications We will not cover methods for modeling categorical outcome variables. So, use only continuous variables as outcomes. DVs in path models and the structural parts of SEMs Observed indicators of latent factors in CFA/SEM NOTE: You may treat ordinal items as continuous, for the purposes of these assignments. We will not cover methods for latent variable interactions. Don’t specify a theoretical model that requires an interaction involving a latent construct. There is one exception to the above prohibition. If the moderator is an observed grouping variable, you can estimate the model as a multiple-group model. We’ll cover these methods in Week 7. Assumptions You need to show that you’re thinking about the assumptions and their impact on your results, but you don’t need to run thorough model diagnostics. Indeed, the task of checking assumptions isn’t nearly as straight forward in path analysis, CFA, and SEM as it is in linear regression modeling. You won’t be able to directly apply the methods you have learned for regression diagnostics, for example. Since all of our models are estimated with normal-theory maximum likelihood, the fundamental assumption of all the models we’ll consider in this course boils down to the following. All random variables in my model are i.i.d. multivariate normally distributed. So, you can get by with basic data screening and checking the observed random variables in your model (i.e., all variables other than fixed predictors) for normality. Since checking for multivariate normality is a bit tricky, we’ll only ask you to evaluate univariate normality. You should do these evaluations via graphical means. To summarize, we’re looking for the following. Data Consider whether the measurement level of your data matches the assumptions of your model. Check your variables for univariate outliers. If you find any outliers, either treat them in some way or explain why you are retaining them for the analysis. Check for missing data. For the purposes of the assignment, you can use complete case analysis to work around the missing data. If you’re up for more of a challenge, feel free to try multiple imputation or full information maximum likelihood. Model Evaluate the univariate normality of any random, observed variables in your model. E.g., DVs in path models, observed IVs modeled as random variables, indicators of latent factors If you fit a multiple-group model for Assignment 3, do this evaluation within groups. Use graphical tools to evaluate the normality assumption. Normal QQ-Plots Histograms Results What do we mean by reporting your results “in a suitable format”? Basically, put some effort into making your results readable, and don’t include a bunch of superfluous information. Part of demonstrating that you understand the analysis is showing that you know which pieces of output convey the important information. Tabulate your results; don’t directly copy the R output. Don’t include everything lavaan gives you. Include only the output needed to understand your results and support your conclusions.

What do you notice when you compare the estimated slopes for each of the three predictors in the multiple regression model with the corresponding estimates from the simple regression models? "],["in-class-exercises-1.html", "2.4 In-Class Exercises", " 2.4 In-Class Exercises During this practical, you will work through some exercises meant to expand your statistical reasoning skills and improve your understanding of linear models. For this exercise, having some familiarity with regression will be helpful. If you feel like you need to refresh your knowledge in this area, consider the resources listed in the Background knowledge section. Data: You will use the following dataset for these exercises. Sesam.sav 2.4.1 Data Exploration Open the file “Sesam.sav” # Load `dplyr` for data processing: library(dplyr) # Load the `haven` library for reading in SPSS files: library(haven) ## Load the &#39;Sesam.sav&#39; data ## Use haven::zap_formats() to remove SPSS attributes sesam &lt;- read_sav(file = &quot;Sesam.sav&quot;) %&gt;% zap_formats() This file is part of a larger dataset that evaluates the impact of the first year of the Sesame Street television series. Sesame Street is mainly concerned with teaching preschool related skills to children in the 3–5 year age range. The following variables will be used in this exercise: age: measured in months prelet: knowledge of letters before watching Sesame Street (range 0–58) prenumb: knowledge of numbers before watching Sesame Street (range 0–54) prerelat: knowledge of size/amount/position relationships before watching Sesame Street (range 0–17) peabody: vocabulary maturity before watching Sesame Street (range 20–120) postnumb: knowledge of numbers after a year of Sesame Street (range 0–54) Note: Unless stated otherwise, the following questions refer to the sesam data and the above variables. 2.4.1.1 What is the type of each variable? Hint: The output of the str() function should be helpful here. Click to show code ## Examine the data structure: str(sesam) ## tibble [240 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ id : num [1:240] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ age : num [1:240] 66 67 56 49 69 54 47 51 69 53 ... ## $ prelet : num [1:240] 23 26 14 11 47 26 12 48 44 38 ... ## $ prenumb : num [1:240] 40 39 9 14 51 33 13 52 42 31 ... ## $ prerelat: num [1:240] 14 16 9 9 17 14 11 15 15 10 ... ## $ peabody : num [1:240] 62 80 32 27 71 32 28 38 49 32 ... ## $ postnumb: num [1:240] 44 39 40 19 54 39 44 51 48 52 ... ## $ gain : num [1:240] 4 0 31 5 3 6 31 -1 6 21 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;display_width&quot;)= int 10 Click for explanation All variables are numeric. str() uses the abbreviation “num” to indicate a numeric vector. 2.4.1.2 What is the average age in the sample? What is the age range (youngest and oldest child)? Hint: Use tidySEM::descriptives() Click to show code As in the take home exercises, you can use the descriptives() function from the tidySEM package to describe the data: library(tidySEM) descriptives(sesam) Click for explanation We can get the average age from the “mean” column in the table ( 51.5), and the age range from the columns “min” and “max”, (34 and 69 respectively.) 2.4.1.3 What is the average gain in knowledge of numbers? What is the standard deviation of this gain? Hints: You will need to compute the gain and save the change score as a new object. You can then use the base-R functions mean() and sd() to do the calculations. Click to show code Create a new variable that represents the difference between pre- and post-test scores on knowledge of numbers: sesam &lt;- mutate(sesam, ndif = postnumb - prenumb) Compute the mean and SD of the change score: sesam %&gt;% summarise(mean(ndif), sd(ndif)) 2.4.1.4 Create an appropriate visualization of the gain scores you computed in 2.4.1.3. Justify your choice of visualization. Hint: Some applicable visualizations are explained in the Visualizations with R section. Click to show code library(ggplot2) ## Create an empty baseline plot object: p &lt;- ggplot(sesam, aes(x = ndif)) ## Add some appropriate geoms: p + geom_histogram() p + geom_density() p + geom_boxplot() Click for explanation Because the gain score is numeric, we should use something appropriate for showing the distribution of a continuous variable. In this case, we can use either a density plot, or a histogram (remember from the lecture, this is like a density plot, but binned). We can also use a box plot, which can be a concise way to display a lot of information about a variable in a little less space. 2.4.1.5 Create a visualization that provides information about the bivariate relationship between the pre- and post-test number knowledge. Justify your choice of visualization. Describe the relationship based on what you see in your visualization. Hint: Again, the Visualizations with R section may provide some useful insights. Click to show code ## Create a scatterplot of the pre- and post-test number knowledge ggplot(sesam, aes(x = prenumb, y = postnumb)) + geom_point() Click for explanation A scatterplot is a good tool for showing patterns in the way that two continuous variables relate to each other. From it, we can quickly gather information about whether a relationship exists, its direction, its strength, how much variation there is, and whether or not a relationship might be non-linear. Based on this scatterplot, we see a positive relationship between the prior knowledge of numbers and the knowledge of numbers at the end of the study. Children who started with a higher level of numeracy also ended with a higher level of numeracy. There is a considerable amount of variance in the relationship. Not every child increases their numeracy between pre-test and post-test. Children show differing amounts of increase. 2.4.2 Linear Modeling 2.4.2.1 Are there significant, bivariate associations between postnumb and the following variables? age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody Use Pearson correlations to answer this question. You do not need to check the assumptions here (though you would in real life). Hint: The base-R cor.test() function and the corr.test() function from the psych package will both conduct hypothesis tests for a correlation coefficients (the base-R cor() function only computes the coefficients). Click to show code library(psych) ## Test the correlations using psych::corr.test(): sesam %&gt;% select(postnumb, age, prelet, prenumb, prerelat, peabody) %&gt;% corr.test() ## Call:corr.test(x = .) ## Correlation matrix ## postnumb age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody ## postnumb 1.00 0.34 0.50 0.68 0.54 0.52 ## age 0.34 1.00 0.33 0.43 0.44 0.29 ## prelet 0.50 0.33 1.00 0.72 0.47 0.40 ## prenumb 0.68 0.43 0.72 1.00 0.72 0.61 ## prerelat 0.54 0.44 0.47 0.72 1.00 0.56 ## peabody 0.52 0.29 0.40 0.61 0.56 1.00 ## Sample Size ## [1] 240 ## Probability values (Entries above the diagonal are adjusted for multiple tests.) ## postnumb age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody ## postnumb 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## age 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prelet 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prenumb 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prerelat 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## peabody 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## ## To see confidence intervals of the correlations, print with the short=FALSE option ## OR ## library(magrittr) ## Test the correlations using multiple cor.test() calls: sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, age) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and age ## t = 5.5972, df = 238, p-value = 5.979e-08 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2241066 0.4483253 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.3410578 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, prelet) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and prelet ## t = 8.9986, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4029239 0.5926632 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5038464 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, prenumb) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and prenumb ## t = 14.133, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.6002172 0.7389277 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.6755051 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, prerelat) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and prerelat ## t = 9.9857, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4475469 0.6268773 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5433818 sesam %$% cor.test(postnumb, peabody) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: postnumb and peabody ## t = 9.395, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4212427 0.6067923 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.520128 Click for explanation Yes, based on the p-values (remember that 0 here really means very small, making it less than .05), we would say that there are significant correlations between postnumb and all other variables in the data. (In fact, all variables in the data are significantly correlated with one another.) 2.4.2.2 Do age and prenumb explain a significant proportion of the variance in postnumb? What statistic did you use to justify your conclusion? Interpret the model fit. Use the lm() function to fit your model.

We use the F statistic for the overall test of model fit to support this conclusion. The variables age and prenumb together explain 45.9% of the variability in postnumb. 2.4.2.3 Write the null and alternative hypotheses tested for in 2.4.2.2. Click for explanation Since we are testing for explained variance, our hypotheses concern the \\(R^2\\). \\[ \\begin{align*} H_0: R^2 = 0\\\\ H_1: R^2 &gt; 0 \\end{align*} \\] Note that this is a directional hypotheses because the \\(R^2\\) cannot be negative. 2.4.2.4 Define the model syntax to estimate the model from 2.4.2.2 as a path analysis using lavaan.

How many regression coefficients are estimated in this model? How many variances are estimated? How many covariances are estimated? Click for explanation Six regression coefficients (red) Four (residual) variances (blue) No covariances 2.4.2.10 Consider a multiple regression analysis with three continuous independent variables: scores on tests of language, history, and logic, and one continuous dependent variable: score on a math test. We want to know if scores on the language, history, and logic tests can predict the math test score. Sketch a path model that you could use to answer this question How many regression parameters are there? How many variances could you estimate? How many covariances could you estimate? 2.4.3 Categorical IVs Load the Drivers.sav data. # Read the data into a data frame named &#39;drivers&#39;: drivers &lt;- read_sav(&quot;Drivers.sav&quot;) %&gt;% as_factor() # This preserves the SPSS labels for nominal variables In this section, we will evaluate the following research question: Does talking on the phone interfere with people&#39;s driving skills? These data come from an experiment. The condition variable represents the three experimental conditions: Hand-held phone Hands-free phone Control (no phone) We will use condition as the IV in our models. The DV, RT, represents the participant’s reaction time (in milliseconds) during a driving simulation. 2.4.3.1 Use the package ggplot2 to create a density plot for the variable RT. What concept are we representing with this plot? Hint: Consider the lap times example from the statistical modeling section of Lecture 2. Click to show code ggplot(drivers, aes(x = RT)) + geom_density() Click for explanation This shows the distribution of all the combined reaction times from drivers in all three categories. 2.4.3.2 Modify this density plot by mapping the variable condition from your data to the fill aesthetic in ggplot. What is the difference between this plot and the previous plot? Do you think there is evidence for differences between the groups? How might we test this by fitting a model to our sample? Click to show code Hint: To modify the transparency of the densities, use the aesthetic alpha. ggplot(drivers, aes(x = RT, fill = condition)) + geom_density(alpha = .5) Click for explanation This figure models the conditional distribution of reaction time, where the type of cell phone usage is the grouping factor. Things you can look at to visually assess whether the three groups differ are the amount of overlap of the distributions, how much distance there is between the individual means, and whether the combined distribution is much different than the conditional distributions. If we are willing to assume that these conditional distributions are normally distributed and have equivalent variances, we could use a linear model with dummy-coded predictors. Aside: ANOVA vs. Linear Regression As you may know, the mathematical model underlying ANOVA is just a linear regression model with nominal IVs. So, in terms of the underlying statistical models, there is no difference between ANOVA and regression; the differences lie in the focus of the analysis. ANOVA is really a type of statistical test wherein we are testing hypotheses about the effects of some set of nominal grouping factors on some continuous outcome. When doing an ANOVA, we usually don’t interact directly with the parameter estimates from the underlying model. Regression is a type of statistical model (i.e., a way to represent a univariate distribution with a conditional mean and fixed variance). When we do a regression analysis, we primarily focus on the estimated parameters of the underling linear model. When doing ANOVA in R, we estimate the model exactly as we would for linear regression; we simply summarize the results differently. If you want to summarize your model in terms of the sums of squares table you usually see when running an ANOVA, you can supply your fitted lm object to the anova() function. This is a statistical modeling course, not a statistical testing course, so we will not consider ANOVA any further. 2.4.3.3 Estimate a linear model that will answer the research question stated in the beginning of this section. Use lm() to estimate the model. Summarize the fitted model and use the results to answer the research question.

"],["lecture-2.html", "3.1 Lecture", " 3.1 Lecture Researchers often have theories about possible causal processes linking multiple variables. Mediation is a particularly important example of such a process in which in an input variable, X, influences the outcome, Y, through an intermediary variable, M (the mediator). For instance, psychotherapy (X), may affect thoughts (M), which in turn affects mood (Y). We can investigate mediation via a specific sequence of linear regression equations, but path modeling will make our lives much easier. We can use path models to simultaneously estimate multiple related regression equations. So, mediation analysis is an ideal application of path modeling. In this lecture, we consider both approaches and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses. As with mediation, researchers often posit theories involving moderation. Moderation implies that the effect of X on Y depends on another variable, Z. For instance, the effect of feedback (X) on performance (Y) may depend on age (Z). Older children might process feedback more effectively than younger children. Hence, the feedback is more effective for older children than for younger children, and the effect of feedback on performance is stronger for older children than for younger children. In such a case, we would say that age moderates the effect of feedback on performance. 3.1.1 Recordings Note: In the following recordings, the slide numbers are a bit of a mess, because I made these videos by cutting together recordings that used different slide decks.

These data comprise 143 observations of the following variables.1 case: Participant ID number ParAtt: Parental Attachment PeerAtt: Peer Attachment Emp: Empathy ProSoc: Prosocial behavior Aggr: Aggression SelfEst: Self-esteem 3.3.1.1 Load the SelfEsteem.sav data. Note: Unless otherwise specified, all analyses in Section 3.3.1 apply to these data. Click to show code library(haven) seData &lt;- read_sav(&quot;SelfEsteem.sav&quot;) Suppose we are interested in the (indirect) effect of peer attachment on self-esteem, and whether empathy has a mediating effect on this relationship. We might generate the following hypotheses: Better peer relationships promote higher self esteem This effect is mediated by a student’s empathy levels, where better peer relationships increase empathy, and higher levels of empathy lead to higher self-esteem. To evaluate these hypotheses, we will use lavaan to estimate a path model. 3.3.1.2 Draw a path model (on paper) that can be used to test the above hypotheses. Label the input (X), outcome (Y), and mediator/intermediary (M). Label the paths a, b, and c’. Hint: Refer back to the Mediation Basics lecture if you need help here.

All three of these effects are positive and significant, including the direct effect of PeerAtt on SelfEst (\\(\\beta = 0.174\\), \\(Z = 1.97\\), \\(p = 0.025\\)), and the parts of the indirect effect made up by the effect of PeerAtt on Emp (\\(\\beta = 0.349\\), \\(Z = 4.63\\), \\(p = 0\\)), and Emp on SelfEst (\\(\\beta = 0.234\\), \\(Z = 2.57\\), \\(p = 0.005\\)). We can see that the direction of the effects seems to support of our hypotheses, but without taking the next steps to investigate the indirect effect, we should be hesitant to say more. Remember that an indirect effect (IE) is the product of multiple regression slopes. Therefore, to estimate an IE, we must define this product in our model syntax. In lavaan, we define the new IE parameter in two steps. Label the relevant regression paths. Use the labels to define a new parameter that represent the desired IE. We can define new parameters in lavaan model syntax via the := operator. The lavaan website contains a tutorial on this procedure: http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/mediation.html 3.3.1.6 Use the procedure described above to modify the model syntax from 3.3.1.3 by adding the definition of the hypothesized IE from PeerAtt to SelfEst.

Note: The p-value above doesn’t match the output because we’re testing a directional hypothesis, but lavaan conducts two-tailed tests for the model parameters. As we learned in the lecture, the above test of the indirect effect is equivalent to Sobel’s Z test (which we don’t really want). An appropriate, robust test of the indirect effect requires bootstrapping, which we will do later this week as part of the in-class exercises. For now, we’ll add another input variable to our model: parental attachment. We will use this model to evaluate the following research questions: Is there a direct effect of parental attachment on self-esteem, after controlling for peer attachment and empathy? Is there a direct effect of peer attachment on self-esteem, after controlling for parental attachment and empathy? Is the effect of parental attachment on self-esteem mediated by empathy, after controlling for peer attachment? Is the effect of peer attachment on self-esteem mediated by empathy, after controlling for parental attachment? 3.3.1.8 Run the path model needed to test the research questions listed above.

Can we say that empathy mediates both paths? Click to show explanation According to the Sobel-style test, after controlling for parental attachment, the indirect effect of peer attachment on self-esteem was statistically significant (\\(\\hat{IE} = 0.063\\), \\(Z = 1.96\\), \\(p = 0.049\\)), as was the analogous direct effect (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.306\\), \\(Z = 3.56\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\)). After controlling for peer attachment, neither the indirect effect (\\(\\hat{IE} = 0.016\\), \\(Z = 0.96\\), \\(p = 0.339\\)) nor the direct effect (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.078\\), \\(Z = 1.05\\), \\(p = 0.296\\)) of parental attachment on self-esteem was significant, though. 3.3.2 Moderation Remember that moderation attempts to describe when one variable influences another.

Make sure that VIEWCAT = 1 is the reference group. Hints: You can identify the reference group with the levels() or contrasts() functions. The reference group is the group labelled with the first level printed by levels(). When you run contrasts(), you will see a pattern matrix that defines a certain dummy coding scheme.

Kids who never or rarely watched Sesame Street had an average score of 18.76 on the post-test. Kids with weekly viewing habits of 2–3, 4–5, or 5+ times per week all had significantly higher scores on the post-test than kids who never or rarely watched Sesame Street (2–3: \\(\\hat{\\beta} = 9.33\\), \\(t = 3.22\\), \\(p = 0.002\\); 4–5: \\(\\hat{\\beta} = 14.71\\), \\(t = 5.3\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\); 5+: \\(\\hat{\\beta} = 18.03\\), \\(t = 6.42\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\)). If we compare the box plot, kernel density plot, and model output below, the relationships between the regression coefficient estimates for the viewing categories and the group means should be evident. 3.3.2.4 Use ggplot() to make a scatterplot with AGE on the x-axis and POSTNUMB on the y-axis. Color the points according to the their VIEWCAT level. Save the plot object to a variable in your environment. Hint: You can map color to the levels of a variable on your dataset by assigning the variable names to the color argument of the aes() function in ggplot(). Click to show code library(ggplot2) ## Add aes(..., color = VIEWCAT) to get different colors for each group: p &lt;- ggplot(sesam2, aes(x = AGE, y = POSTNUMB, color = VIEWCAT)) + geom_point() # Add points for scatterplot ## Print the plot stored as &#39;p&#39;: p We assigned the global color aesthetic to the VIEWCAT variable, so the points are colored based on their group. 3.3.2.5 Add linear regression lines for each group to the above scatterplot. Hints: You can add regression lines with ggplot2::geom_smooth() To get linear regression lines, set the argument method = \"lm\" To omit error envelopes, set the argument se = FALSE Click to show code ## Add OLS best-fit lines: p + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) The global color aesthetic assignment from above carries through to any additional plot elements that we add, including the regression lines. So, we also get a separate regression line for each VIEWCAT group. 3.3.2.6 How would you interpret the pattern of regression lines above? Click for explanation All the lines show a positive slope, so post-test number recognition appears to increase along with increasing age. The lines are not parallel, though. So VIEWCAT may be moderating the effect of AGE on POSTNUMB. Based on the figure we just created, we may want to test for moderation in our regression model. To do so, we need to add an interaction between AGE and VIEWCAT. The VIEWCAT factor is represented by 3 dummy codes in our model, though. So when we interact AGE and VIEWCAT, we will create 3 interaction terms. To test the overall moderating influence of VIEWCAT, we need to conduct a multiparameter hypothesis test of all 3 interaction terms. One way that we can go about implementing such a test is through a hierarchical regression analysis entailing three steps: Estimate the additive model wherein we regress POSTNUMB onto AGE and VIEWCAT without any interaction. Estimate the moderated model by adding the interaction between AGE and VIEWCAT into the additive model. Conduct a \\(\\Delta R^2\\) test to compare the fit of the two models. 3.3.2.7 Conduct the hierarchical regression analysis described above. Does VIEWCAT significantly moderate the effect of AGE on POSTNUMB? Provide statistical justification for your conclusion.

Recall that these data comprise 143 observations of the following variables. case: Participant ID number ParAtt: Parental Attachment PeerAtt: Peer Attachment Emp: Empathy ProSoc: Prosocial behavior Aggr: Aggression SelfEst: Self-esteem When we last worked with the data, we built a model with one mediator (Emp), creating indirect effects between our predictors ParAtt and PeerAtt, and our outcome variable SelfEst. Below, you will estimate a more complex, multiple-mediator model. 3.4.1.1 Load the data into the object seData using haven::read_sav() Click to show code library(haven) seData &lt;- read_sav(&quot;SelfEsteem.sav&quot;) For this analysis, we are interested in the (indirect) effects of parental and peer attachment on self-esteem. Furthermore, we want to evaluate the mediating roles of empathy and social behavior (i.e., prosocial behavior and aggression). Specifically, we have the following hypotheses. Better peer relationships will promote higher self-esteem via a three-step indirect process. Better peer relationships will increase empathy levels. Higher empathy will increase prosocial behavior and decrease aggressive behavior. More prosocial behaviors and less aggressive behavior will both produce higher self-esteem. Better relationships with parents directly increase self-esteem. To evaluate these hypotheses, we will use lavaan to estimate the following multiple mediator model as a path model. 3.4.1.2 Specify the lavaan model syntax implied by the path diagram shown above.

Click for explanation Notice that all of the hypotheses stated above are explicitly directional. Hence, when evaluating the significance of the structural paths that speak to these hypotheses, we should use one-tailed tests. We cannot ask lavaan to return one-tailed p-values, but we have no need to do so. We can simply divide the two-tailed p-values in half. The significant direct effect of ParAtt on SelfEst (\\(\\beta = 0.244\\), \\(Z = 3.13\\), \\(p = 0.001\\)) and the lack of a significant direct effect of PeerAtt on SelfEst (\\(\\beta = 0.051\\), \\(Z = 0.555\\), \\(p = 0.29\\)) align with our hypotheses. The remaining patterns of individual estimates also seem to conform to the hypotheses (e.g., all of the individual paths comprising the indirect effects of PeerAtt on SelfEst are significant). We cannot make any firm conclusions until we actually estimate and test the indirect effects, though. 3.4.1.5 Modify the model syntax from 3.4.1.2 by adding definitions of the two hypothesized IEs from PeerAtt to SelfEst. Click to show code You can use any labeling scheme that makes sense to you, but I recommend adopting some kind of systematic rule.

Though, this latter effect is just barely significant at the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level. The tests we used to evaluate the significance of the IEs in 3.4.1.6 are flawed because they assume normal sampling distributions for the IEs. However the IEs are defined as products of multiple, normally distributed, regression slopes. So the IEs themselves cannot be normally distributed (at least in finite samples), and the results of the normal-theory significance tests may be misleading. To get an accurate test of the IEs, we should use bootstrapping to generate an empirical sampling distribution for each IE. In lavaan, we implement bootstrapping by specifying the se = \"bootstrap\" option in the fitting function (i.e., the cfa() or sem() function) and specifying the number of bootstrap samples via the bootstrap option. Workflow Tip To draw reliable conclusions from bootstrapped results, we need many bootstrap samples (i.e., B &gt; 1000), but we must estimate the full model for each of these samples, so the estimation can take a long time. To avoid too much frustration, you should first estimate the model without bootstrapping to make sure everything is specified correctly. Only after you are certain that your code is correct do you want to run the full bootstrapped version. 3.4.1.7 Re-estimate the model from 3.4.1.6 using 1000 bootstrap samples. Other than the se and bootstrap options, use the defaults. Are the hypothesized IEs significant according to the bootstrap-based test statistics?

Note: Bootstrapping is a stochastic method, so each run can provide different results. Since the indirect effect of aggressive behavior is so close to the critical value, you may come to a different conclusions vis-á-vis statistical significance if you run this analysis with a different random number seed or a different number of bootstrap samples. When you use the summary() function to summarize the bootstrapped model from 3.4.1.7, the output will probably look pretty much the same as it did in 3.4.1.6, but it’s not. The standard errors and test statistics in the bootstrapped summary are derived from empirical sampling distributions, whereas these values are based on an assumed normal sampling distribution in 3.4.1.6. The standard method of testing IEs with bootstrapping is to compute confidence intervals (CIs) from the empirical sampling distribution of the IEs. In lavaan, we can compute basic (percentile, 95%) CIs by adding the ci = TRUE option to the summary() function. To evaluate our directional hypotheses at an \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level, however, we need to compute 90% CIs. We can get more control over the summary statistics (include the CIs) with the parameterEstimates() function. 3.4.1.8 Check the documentation for lavaan::parameterEstimates(). Click to show code ?parameterEstimates 3.4.1.9 Use the parameterEstimates() function to compute bootstrapped CIs for the hypothesized IEs. Compute percentile CIs. Are the IEs significant according to the bootstrapped CIs? Click to show code parameterEstimates(out_boot, ci = TRUE, level = 0.9) Click for explanation When evaluating a directional hypothesis with a CI, we only consider one of the interval’s boundaries. For a hypothesized positive effect, we check only if the lower boundary is greater than zero. For a hypothesized negative effect, we check if the upper boundary is less than zero. As with the previous tests, the IE of Peer Attachment on Self Esteem through Empathy and Prosocial Behavior is significant (\\(\\hat{\\textit{IE}} = 0.037\\), \\(95\\% ~ CI = [0.009; \\infty]\\)), but the analogous IE through Aggressive Behavior is not quite significant (\\(\\hat{\\textit{IE}} = -0.017\\), \\(95\\% ~ CI = [-\\infty; -0.003]\\)). 3.4.1.10 Based on the analyses you’ve conducted here, what do you conclude vis-à-vis the original hypotheses? Click for explanation When using normal-theory tests, both hypothesized indirect effects between Peer Attachment and Self Esteem were supported in that the IE through Empathy and Prosocial Behavior as well as the IE through Empathy and Aggressive Behavior were both significant. The hypothesized direct effect of Parent Attachment on Self Esteem was also born out via a significant direct effect in the model. When testing the indirect effects with bootstrapping, however, the effect through Aggressive Behavior was nonsignificant. Since bootstrapping gives a more accurate test of the indirect effect, we should probably trust these results more than the normal-theory results. We should not infer a significant indirect effect of Peer Attachment on Self Esteem transmitted through Empathy and Aggressive Behavior. These results may not tell the whole story, though. We have not tested for indirect effects between Parent Attachment and Self Esteem, and we have not evaluated simpler indirect effects between Peer Attachment and Self Esteem (e.g., PeerAtt \\(\\rightarrow\\) Emp \\(\\rightarrow\\) SelfEst). 3.4.2 Moderation We will first analyze a synthetic version of the Outlook on Life Survey data. The original data were collected in the United States in 2012 to measure, among other things, attitudes about racial issues, opinions of the Federal government, and beliefs about the future. We will work with a synthesized subset of the original data. You can access these synthetic data as outlook.rds. This dataset comprises 2288 observations of the following 13 variables. d1:d3: Three observed indicators of a construct measuring disillusionment with the US Federal government. Higher scores indicate more disillusionment s1:s4: Four observed indicators of a construct measuring the perceived achievability of material success. Higher scores indicate greater perceived achievability progress: A single item assessing perceived progress toward achieving the “American Dream” Higher scores indicate greater perceived progress merit: A single item assessing endorsement of the meritocratic ideal that hard work leads to success. Higher scores indicate stronger endorsement of the meritocratic ideal lib2Con: A single item assessing liberal-to-conservative orientation Lower scores are more liberal, higher scores are more conservative party: A four-level factor indicating self-reported political party affiliation disillusion: A scale score representing disillusionment with the US Federal government Created as the mean of d1:d3 success: A scale score representing the perceived achievability of material success Created as the mean of s1:s4 To satisfy the access and licensing conditions under which the original data are distributed, the data contained in outlook.rds were synthesized from the original variables using the methods described by Volker and Vink (2021).

End of In-Class Exercises 3 "],["efa.html", "4 EFA", " 4 EFA This week will be a general introduction to latent variables and scaling procedures. We will discuss several different aspects of exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Most notably: The differences between Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and Factor Analysis Model estimation and factor extraction methods Factor rotations You will have to make decisions regarding each of these aspects when conducting a factor analysis. We will also discuss reliability and factor scores as means of evaluating the properties of a scale. Homework before the lecture Watch the Lecture Recording for this week.

"],["lecture-3.html", "4.1 Lecture", " 4.1 Lecture How do you know if you have measured the putative hypothetical construct that you intend to measure? The methods introduced in this lecture (namely, latent variables, factor analysis, and reliability analysis) can shed empirical light on this issue. In the social and behavioral sciences we’re often forced to measure key concepts indirectly. For example, we have no way of directly quantifying a person’s current level of depression, or their innate motivation, or their risk-aversion, or any of the other myriad psychological features that comprise the human mental state. In truth, we cannot really measure these hypothetical constructs at all, we must estimate latent representations thereof (though, psychometricians still use the language of physical measurement to describe this process). Furthermore, we can rarely estimate an adequate representation with only a single observed variable (e.g., question on a survey, score on a test, reading from a sensor). We generally need several observed variables to reliably represent a single hypothetical construct. For example, we cannot accurately determine someone’s IQ or socio-economic status based on their response to a single question; we need several questions that each tap into slightly different aspects of IQ or SES. Given multiple items measuring the same construct, we can use the methods discussed in this lecture (i.e., factor analysis and reliability analysis) to evaluate the quality of our measurement (i.e., how well we have estimated the underlying hypothetical construct). If we do well enough in this estimation task, we will be able to combine these estimated latent variables with the path analysis methods discussed in previous two weeks to produce the full structural equation models that we will cover at the end of this course. 4.1.1 Recording Notes: This week (and next), we’ll be re-using Caspar van Lissa’s old slides and lecture recording. So, you’ll see Caspar in the following video, and the slides will have a notably different flavor than our usual materials. Don’t be confused by any mention of “model fit” in the lecture. We haven’t covered model fit yet, but we will do so next week. 4.1.2 Slides You can download the lecture slides here.

What is factor analysis, and what can you investigate using this method? In the introduction, Preacher and Maccallum describe a “little jiffy” method of doing factor analysis. Briefly describe this little jiffy—or bad practice—method. Briefly explain the key differences between Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and Exploratory Factor Analyses (EFA). What is the purpose of factor rotation? Reference 2 Kestilä, E. (2006). Is there demand for radical right populism in the Finnish electorate? Scandinavian Political Studies 29(3), 169–191. Questions 2 What is the research question that the author tries to answer? Briefly describe the characteristics of the Radical Right Parties (RRP) in Europe. What are the two main explanations of support for RRP upon which this paper focuses? Does the empirical part of the paper reflect the theoretical framework well? Why or why not?

Click for explanation In keeping with conventions, we will treat ordinal Likert-type rating scales with five or more levels as continuous. Consequently, we need to convert these variables from factors to numeric vectors. We can convert a factor to a numeric variable using the as.numeric() function, but this function only operates on one variable at a time. To replicate the Kestilä (2006) analysis, we need to convert 37 variables. Thankfully, we can use apply functions to broadcast univariate operation across each column (or row) of a dataset. We are specifically interested in the lapply() function. The lapply() function applies some function to each element in a list (e.g., each column in a data frame). The variables we care about live in columns 7 to 44 of the ess dataset. In the following code, we apply the as.numeric() function to these columns and overwrite their original factor versions with the converted numeric data. ess[7:44] &lt;- lapply(ess[7:44], as.numeric) In addition to screening with summary statistics, we can also visualize the variables’ distributions. You have already created a few such visualizations for single variables. Now, we will use a few tricks to efficiently plot each of our target variables. The first step in this process will be to convert the interesting part of our data from “wide format” (one column per variable) into “long format” (one column of variable names, one column of data values). The pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package provides a convenient way to execute this conversion. 4.3.5 Use tidyr::pivot_longer() to create a long-formatted data frame from the target variables in ess (i.e., columns 7 to 44). Click to show code ## Load the tidyr package: library(tidyr) ## Convert the target variables into a long-formatted data frame: ess_plot &lt;- pivot_longer(ess[7:44], colnames(ess)[7:44]) The next step in the process will be to plot the variables using ggplot(). To create one plot for each variable, we will use the facet_wrap() function to facet the plots on the ess_plot$name column (i.e., create a separate conditional plot for each unique value in ess_plot$name). 4.3.6 Use ggplot() with an appropriate geom (e.g., geom_histogram(), geom_density(), geom_boxplot()) and facet_wrap() to visualize each of the target variables. Hint: To implement the faceting, simply add facet_wrap(~ name, scales = \"free_x\") to the end of your ggplot() call. Click to show code library(ggplot2) ggplot(ess_plot, aes(x = value)) + geom_histogram() + # Create a histogram facet_wrap(~ name, scales = &quot;free_x&quot;) # Facet on &#39;name&#39; Click for explanation Notice that the variables are actually discrete (i.e., each variable takes only a few integer values). However, most variables look relatively normal despite being categorical. So, it’s probably fine to analyze these variables as continuous. 4.3.7 Check the descriptives for the target variables again. Do you see any remaining issues? Click to show code descriptives(ess[7:44]) Click for explanation No. Everything looks pretty much fine. Now, we’re ready to run the analyses and see if we can replicate the Kestilä (2006) results. 4.3.8 Run two principal component analyses (PCA): one for trust in politics, one for attitudes towards immigration. Use the principal() function from the psych package. Use exactly the same specifications as Kestilä (2006) concerning the estimation method, rotation, number of components extracted, etc. Hints: Remember that you can view the help file for psych::principal() by running ?psych::principal or, if the psych package already loaded, simply running ?principal. When you print the output from psych::principal(), you can use the cut option to hide any factor loadings smaller than a given threshold. You could consider hiding any loadings smaller than those reported by Kestilä (2006) to make the output easier to interpret.

PCA is a dimension reduction technique that distills the most salient information from a set of variables into a (smaller) set of component scores. Hence, PCA can be a good way of creating aggregate items (analogous to weighted scale scores) when the data are not collected with validated scales. Principal component scores are automatically generated when we run the PCA. If we want to use these scores in subsequent analyses (e.g., as predictors in a regression model), we usually add them to our dataset as additional columns. 4.3.9 Add the component scores produced by the analyses you ran above to the ess data frame. Give each component score an informative name, based on your interpretation of the factor loading matrix I.e., What hypothetical construct do you think each component represents given the items that load onto it? Hints: You can use the data.frame() function to join multiple objects into a single data frame. You can use the colnames() function to assign column names to a matrix or data frame. 1.

Click for explanation Yes, more-or-less. Although the exact estimates differ somewhat, the general pattern of factor loadings in Kestilä (2006) matches what we found here. "],["in-class-exercises-3.html", "4.4 In-Class Exercises", " 4.4 In-Class Exercises In these exercises, we will continue with our re-analysis/replication of the Kestilä (2006) results. Rather than attempting a direct replication, we will now redo the analysis using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). 4.4.1 Load the ESSround1-b.csv dataset. These are the same data that you analyzed for the At-Home Exercises, but the processing/recoding that you should have done for those exercises has already been implemented. ess &lt;- read.csv(&quot;ESSround1-b.csv&quot;) 4.4.2 Kestilä (2006) claimed that running a PCA is a good way to test if the questions in the ESS measure attitudes towards immigration and trust in politics. Based on what you’ve learned from the readings and lectures, do you agree with this position? Click for explanation Hopefully not. PCA is not a method for estimating latent measurement structure; PCA is a dimension reduction technique that tries to summarize a set of data with a smaller set of component scores. If we really want to estimate the factor structure underlying a set of observed variables, we should use EFA. 4.4.3 Suppose you had to construct the trust in politics and attitude towards immigration scales described by Kestilä (2006) based on the theory and background information presented in that article. What type of analysis would you choose? What key factors would influence your decision? Click for explanation We are trying to estimate meaningful latent factors, so EFA would be an appropriate method. The theory presented by Kestilä (2006) did not hypothesize a particular number of factors, so we would need to use appropriate techniques to estimate the best number. In particular, combining information from: Scree plots Parallel analysis Substantive interpretability of the (rotated) factor loadings Since the factors are almost certainly correlated, we should apply an oblique rotation. We will now rerun the two PCAs that you conducted for the At-Home Exercises using EFA. We will estimate the EFA models using the psych::fa() function, but we need to know how many factors to extract. We could simply estimate a range of solutions and compare the results. We can restrict the range of plausible solutions and save some time by first checking/plotting the eigenvalues and running parallel analysis. 4.4.4 Estimate the number of latent factors underlying the Trust items based on the eigenvalues, the scree plot, and parallel analysis. How many factors are suggested by each method? Hint: You can create a scree plot by supplying the vector of eigenvalues to the qplot() function from the ggplot2 package and applying the geom_path() geometry. Click to show code (EFA) ## Load the psych package: library(psych) ## Run a trivial EFA on the &#39;trust&#39; items efa_trust0 &lt;- fa(ess[7:19], nfactors = 1, rotate = &quot;none&quot;) Click for explanation (EFA) First, we’ll run a trivial EFA using the psych::fa() function to get eigenvalues. We don’t care about the factors yet, so we can extract a single factor. We also don’t care about interpretable solutions, so we don’t need rotation. Click to show code (eigenvalue extraction) round(efa_trust0$values, digits = 3) ## [1] 4.940 0.733 0.492 0.173 0.064 0.014 -0.066 -0.091 -0.195 -0.210 ## [11] -0.289 -0.307 -0.318 Click for explanation (eigenvalue extraction) We can check the eigenvalues to see what proportion of the observed variance is accounted for by each additional factor we may extract. Since only one eigenvalue is greater than one, the so-called “Kaiser Criterion” would suggest extracting a single factor. The Kaiser Criterion is not a valid way to select the number of factors in EFA. So, we don’t want to rely on this information alone. We can still use the eigenvalues to help us with factor enumeration, though. One way to do so is by plotting the eigenvalues in a scree plot. Click to show code (scree plot) We can easily create a scree plot by passing the eigenvalues to the qplot() function from the ggplot2 package and add apply the geom_path() geometry library(ggplot2) qplot(y = efa_trust0$values) + geom_path() + ylab(&quot;Eigenvalues&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Factors&quot;) Click for explanation (scree plot) Although the scree plot provides useful information, we need to interpret that information subjectively, and the conclusions are sometimes ambiguous. In this case, the plot seems to suggest either one or three components, depending on where we consider the “elbow” to lie. As recommended in the lecture, we can also use “parallel analysis” (Horn, to provide more quantified information about the number of factors. We’ll use the psych::fa.parallel() function to implement parallel analysis. Parallel analysis relies on randomly simulated/permuted data, so we should set a seed to make sure our results are reproducible. We can set the fa = \"fa\" option to get only the results for EFA. Click to show code (parallel analysis) ## Set the random number seed: set.seed(235711) ## Run the parallel analysis: pa_trust &lt;- fa.parallel(ess[7:19], fa = &quot;fa&quot;) ## Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 5 and the number of components = NA Click for explanation (parallel analysis) The results of the parallel analysis suggest 5 factors. If you’ve been paying close attention, you may have noticed that we need to compute the eigenvalues from the original data to run parallel analysis. Hence, we don’t actually need to run a separate EFA to estimate the eigenvalues. ## View the eigenvalues estimated during the parallel analysis: pa_trust$fa.values ## [1] 4.93985031 0.73335474 0.49174655 0.17294854 0.06372444 0.01363969 ## [7] -0.06605432 -0.09109183 -0.19535125 -0.20991379 -0.28855561 -0.30662420 ## [13] -0.31782296 ## Compare to the version from the EFA: pa_trust$fa.values - efa_trust0$values ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Recreate the scree plot from above: qplot(y = pa_trust$fa.values) + geom_path() + ylab(&quot;Eigenvalues&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Factors&quot;) Click for explanation (number of latent factors) The different criteria disagree on how many factors we should extract, but we have narrowed the range. Based on the scree plot and parallel analysis, we should consider solutions for 3 to 5 factors. We need to examine the factor loadings to see which solution makes the most substantive sense. 4.4.5 Do the same analysis for the attitudes toward immigration items. Click to show code This time, we’ll start by running the parallel analysis and get the eigenvalues from the object returned by psych::fa.parallel(). ## Set the seed: set.seed(235711) ## Run parallel analysis on the &#39;attitudes&#39; items: pa_att &lt;- fa.parallel(ess[20:44]) ## Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 7 and the number of components = 5 ## Check the eigenvalues: round(pa_att$fa.values, digits = 3) ## [1] 7.841 1.474 0.748 0.534 0.327 0.152 0.123 0.025 -0.033 -0.064 ## [11] -0.081 -0.098 -0.121 -0.137 -0.145 -0.179 -0.196 -0.204 -0.214 -0.222 ## [21] -0.246 -0.253 -0.331 -0.425 -0.432 ## Create a scree plot: qplot(y = pa_att$fa.values) + geom_path() + ylab(&quot;Eigenvalues&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Factors&quot;) Click for explanation For the attitudes toward immigration analysis, the results are even more ambiguous than they were for the trust items. The Kaiser Criterion suggests 2 factors The scree plot is hopelessly ambiguous At least 3 factors? No more than 9 factors? Parallel analysis suggests 7 factors Based on the scree plot and parallel analysis, it seems reasonable to consider solutions for 3 to 7 factors. Again, we need to check the substantive interpretation to choose the most reasonable solution. To evaluate the substantive interpretability of the different solutions, we need to estimate the full EFA models for each candidate number of factors. We then compare the factor loadings across solutions to see which set of loading define the most reasonable set of latent variables. 4.4.6 For the trust items, estimate the EFA models for each plausible number of components that you identified above. Use the psych::fa() function to estimate the models. You will need to specify a few key options. The data (including only the variables you want to analyze) The number of factors that you want to extract The rotation method The estimation method The method of estimating factor scores Hint: You can save yourself a lot of typing/copy-pasting (and the attendant chances of errors) by using a for() loop to iterate through numbers of factors.

The factor loadings matrix indicates how strongly each latent factor (columns) associates with the observed items (rows). We can interpret these factor loadings in the same way that we would interpret regression coefficients (indeed, a factor analytic model can be viewed as a multivariate regression model wherein the latent factors are the predictors and the observed items are the outcomes). A higher factor loading indicates a stronger association between the item and factor linked by that loading. Items with high factor loadings are “good” indicators of the respective factors. Items with only very low loadings do not provide much information about any factor. You may want to exclude such items from your analysis. Note that the size of the factor loadings depends on the number of factors. So, you should only consider excluding an observed item after you have chosen the number of latent factors. When we print the loading matrix, we see additional information printed below the factor loadings. Proportion Var: What proportion of the items’ variance is explained by each of the factors. Cumulative Var: How much variance the factors explain, in total. If you estimated as many factors as items, then the Cumulative Var for the final factor would be 1.00 (i.e., 100%). 4.4.9 Compare the factor loading matrices from the models estimated from the Attitudes items, and select the best solution.

One way to test for differences between the individual countries would be a post hoc test of all pairwise comparisons. Since we’ll be doing 45 tests, we need to apply a correction for repeated testing. Above, we use Tukey’s HSD correction. The second part of the Kestilä (2006) analysis was to evaluate how socio-demographic characteristics affected attitudes towards immigrants and trust in politics among the Finnish electorate. Before we can replicate this part of the analysis, we need to subset the data to only the Finnish cases. 4.4.12 Create a new data frame that contains only the Finnish cases from ess. Hint: You can use logical indexing based on the cntry variable. Click to show code ess_finland &lt;- ess[ess$cntry == &quot;Finland&quot;, ] We still have one more step before we can estimate any models. We must prepare our variables for analysis. Our dependent variables will be the factor scores generated above. So, we do not need to apply any further processing. We have not yet used any of the independent variables, though. So, we should inspect those variables to see if they require any processing. In the ess data, the relevant variables have the following names: gndr yrbrn eduyrs polintr lrscale 4.4.13 Inspect the independent variables listed above. Click to show code (descriptives) library(tidySEM) descriptives(ess_finland[c(&quot;gndr&quot;, &quot;yrbrn&quot;, &quot;eduyrs&quot;, &quot;polintr&quot;, &quot;lrscale&quot;)]) Click to show code (yrbrn) ess_finland$age &lt;- 2002 - ess_finland$yrbrn Click for explanation (yrbrn) It looks like we still need some recoding. 1. Age The data contain the participants’ years of birth instead of their age, but Kestilä analyzed age. Fortunately, we know that the data were collected in 2002, so we can simply subtract each participant’s value of yrbrn from the 2002 to compute their age. Click to show code (polintr) ## Load the dplyr package: library(dplyr) ## Recode the four character values into two factor levels: ess_finland$polintr_bin &lt;- recode_factor(ess_finland$polintr, &quot;Not at all interested&quot; = &quot;Low Interest&quot;, &quot;Hardly interested&quot; = &quot;Low Interest&quot;, &quot;Quite interested&quot; = &quot;High Interest&quot;, &quot;Very interested&quot; = &quot;High Interest&quot;) ## Check the conversion: table(old = ess_finland$polintr, new = ess_finland$polintr_bin) ## new ## old Low Interest High Interest ## Hardly interested 842 0 ## Not at all interested 228 0 ## Quite interested 0 785 ## Very interested 0 144 Click for explanation (polintr) 2. Political Interest &amp; Political Orientation The variables polintr and lrscale are represented as character vectors. If we analyze these variables as they are, R will convert the character vectors to factors and make dummy codes for each distinct value; we definitely don’t want that. We need to convert polintr and lrscale to numeric vectors, but we cannot naively apply the as.numeric() function, because R doesn’t know how to convert a word into a number (or, at least, not how we want the operation to be done). There are many ways that we could go about this conversion, but the recode() function from the dplyr package is particularly useful for arbitrary recoding tasks such as we have here. Kestilä (2006) dichotomized polintr by combining the lowest two and highest two categories. So, we don’t actually want to convert the polint variable into a numeric, Likert-type variable. We want polint to be a binary factor. The recode_factor() function from dplyr() will automatically convert our result into a factor. Click to show code (lrscale) ## Recode the extreme levels: tmp &lt;- recode(ess_finland$lrscale, &quot;Left&quot; = 0, &quot;Right&quot; = 10, .default = as.numeric(ess_finland$lrscale) ) ## Check the conversion: table(old = ess_finland$lrscale, new = tmp) ## new ## old 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## 1 0 25 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 0 0 62 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 3 0 0 0 148 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 4 0 0 0 0 183 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 0 0 0 0 0 599 0 0 0 0 0 ## 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 199 0 0 0 0 ## 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 296 0 0 0 ## 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 217 0 0 ## 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 79 0 ## Left 24 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Right 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 59 ## Overwrite the old variable: ess_finland$lrscale &lt;- tmp Click for explanation For political orientation, only the two extreme values of the scale are labeled as text. So, we only need to recode those two levels. Since we’re only replacing two of the 11 values, we’ll need to provide a value for the .default argument in dplyr::recode(). Click to show code (sex) ess_finland$sex &lt;- factor(ess_finland$gndr) Click for explanation 3. Sex Although gndr would be automatically converted to a factor by lm(), it’s better to be explicit about our intentions and create the factor ourselves. Now, we’re finally ready to replicate the regression analysis from Kestilä (2006). Creating a single aggregate score by summing the individual component scores is a pretty silly thing to do, though. So, we won’t reproduce that aspect of the analysis. 4.4.14 Run a series of multiple linear regression analyses with the factor scores you created in 4.4.10 as the dependent variables and the same predictors used by Kestilä (2006).

One of the most common applications of EFA is scale development. Given a pool of items without a known factor structure, we try to estimate the underlying latent factors that define the (sub)scales represented by our items. In such applications, we use the factor loading matrix for our optimal solution to make “bright-line” assignments of items to putative factors according to the simple structure represented by the estimated factor loading matrix. In other words, we disregard small factor loadings and assign observed items to only the single latent factor upon which they load most strongly. We then hypothesize that those items are true indicators of that latent factor. We can use confirmatory factor analysis (which you will learn about next week) to test rigorously this hypothesis, but we can already get started by estimating the internal consistency (a type of reliability) of the hypothesized subscales. 4.4.15 Estimate the internal consistency of the three Trust subscales and five Attitudes subscales implied by your EFA solutions from above. Use Cronbach’s Alpha to quantify internal consistency. Use the alpha() function from the psych() package to conduct the analysis. Run your analysis on the full ess dataset, not the Finnish subset. Are the subscales implied by your EFA reliable, in the sense of good internal consistency? Note that \\(\\alpha &gt; 0.7\\) is generally considered acceptable, and \\(\\alpha &gt; 0.8\\) is usually considered good.

According to our EFA, the Satisfaction subscale should be indicated by the following five variables: stfeco stfgov stfdem stfedu stfhlth To estimate the internal consistency of this subscale, we simply provide a data frame containing only the subscale data to the alpha() function. The raw_alpha value is the estimate of Cronbach’s Alpha. In this case \\(\\alpha = 0.795\\), so the subscale is pretty reliable. The table labeled “Reliability if an item is dropped” shows what Cronbach’s Alpha would be if each item were excluded from the scale. If this value is notably higher than the raw_alpha value, it could indicate a bad item. Note that reliability is only one aspect of scale quality, though. So, you shouldn’t throw out items just because they perform poorly in reliability analysis.

A. (2006). A brief guide to structural equation modeling. The Counseling Psychologist 34, 719–752. Notes: This article is quite general and provides an overview of things we have discussed so far in this course. This article also also adds an important new idea: combining factor analysis with path modeling to produce a full Structural Equation Model (SEM). Skip the part on GFI (p. 741). The GFI has been shown to be too dependent on sample size and is not recommended any longer. Skip the part on missing data. There is nothing wrong with this section, but missing data analysis is a broad and difficult topic that we cannot adequately cover in this course. If you would like to learn more about missing data and how to treat them, you can take two courses offered by our department: Conducting a Survey Missing Data Theory and Causal Effects Questions The authors state three similarities and two big differences between SEM and other multivariate statistical techniques (e.g., ANCOVA, regression). What are these similarities and differences? Do you agree with the relative strengths and weaknesses of SEM vs. other methods that the authors present? The authors miss at least one additional advantage of SEM over other multivariate methods. What is this missing advantage? Explain what the terms “measurement model” and “structural model” mean in the SEM context. What are the 6 steps of doing an SEM-based analysis given by the authors? The authors claim that testing an SEM using cross-validation is a good idea. When is cross-validation helpful in SEM? Hint: You may have to do some independent (internet, literature) research to learn how cross-validation can be implemented in SEM.
