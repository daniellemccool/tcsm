Lang Last updated: 2022-09-20 Course Information In order to test a theory, we must express the theory as a statistical model and then test this model on quantitative (numeric) data. In this course we will use datasets from different disciplines within the social sciences (educational sciences, psychology, and sociology) to explain and illustrate theories and practices that are used in all social science disciplines to statistically model social science theories. This course uses existing tutorial datasets to practice the process of translating verbal theories into testable statistical models. If you are interested in the methods of acquiring high quality data to test your own theory, we recommend following the course Conducting a Survey which is taught from November to January.

After completing the course, you will be able to: Translate a verbal theory into a conceptual model, and translate a conceptual model into a statistical model. Independently analyze data using the free, open-source statistical software R. Apply a latent variable model to a real-life problem wherein the observed variables are only indirect indicators of an unobserved construct. Use a path model to represent the hypothesized causal relations among several variables, including relationships such as mediation and moderation. Explain to a fellow student how structural equation modeling combines latent variable models with path models and the benefits of doing so. Reflect critically on the decisions involved in defining and estimating structural equation models.

If you’re one of the majority without data, you’ll have to find an existing dataset to analyze (in case you were wondering, you won’t have time to collect new data). Sources Those who need data can make use of one of the myriad publicly available datasets available online. Of course these datasets will vary widely in terms of their applicability to the project and the amount of work required to prepare the variables for analysis. The following links point to various sources of publicly available data. Kaggle datasets GSS Sata Explorer StatLine Open Data Open Data from the Dutch Government Google Cloud Platform Google dataset search Tips When searching for a suitable dataset, consider the following tips: It will take longer than you expect. Start searching for data early. Plan on devoting a good chunk of time to tracking down a useful dataset. Realize that even after you find the data, you will also have to do a good bit of cleaning to get the variables ready for analysis. Expect to be disappointed. You may find a dataset that looks good on paper but won’t work for the project (e.g., too much missing data, poor coverage for key relations, jenky distributions, etc.). You usually won’t discover these issue until you’ve already downloaded the data and started exploring/cleaning. Make sure you check the actual data you’ve downloaded before you declare success in your search. Keep the project requirements in mind when searching for data. You will need, at least, three interesting variables to model in some sort of causal process (required for Assignment 3). You will need, at least, one latent variable (required for Assignments 1 &amp; 3). To define a latent variable, you need multiple items (at least three) measuring the same hypothetical construct. In practice, these multiple indicators usually come from scales (e.g., NEO-PI Big Five Personality Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory). If you find a dataset that looks suitable, but you want to confirm, send me (Kyle) a link to the dataset, and I’ll let you know if it will work for the assignments.

Length In the preceding three sections, some line-items in the descriptions of the assignments concluded with a word count. These sections of your report must conform to the indicated word counts. E.g., the Data section of Assignment 1 must contain no more that 150 words, and the Discussion section of Assignment 3 must contain no more than 500 words. In all other sections, you may use as many words as necessary to adequately explain yourself (though concision and parsimony are still encouraged). Note that the assignments are not intended to be full-blown papers! You only get a few hundred words to describe your data, justify your theoretical model, and discuss the results. The focus should be on the definition of your model, how this model relates to theory (introduction), and what you have learned from your estimated model (discussion).

RStudio helps you use and learn R more easily. Although you are interacting with RStudio, you are still using R. Don’t ever write something like, “We conducted all analysis with RStudio…” For this course, all tutorials and practicals will use RStudio. 0.5.1 No ‘pane’, no gain! When you open RStudio, the screen should look something like the following image. You will notice that the window is divided into ‘panes’ (a pane is a division of a window). Before we explain these three panes, I want you to add another, which you will see if you open an R script. An R script is simply a plain-text file wherein you will write the R code that executes your analyses. When you open an R script (or create a new one, which is really the same thing), a fourth pane appears. 0.5.2 Create a new R script To create a new R script, Click the icon with a plus sign on the paper (highlighted below by the red square). When you click this icon, a new script is generated and appears in a fourth pane on the upper left side of the screen (if you’re using the default layout). Note that this script is not yet saved anywhere. If you close this script without saving, you will lose all its contents. The four panes help organize your workflow. Rstudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is meant to integrate all of the tasks you may need to do for any R-based analysis, programming, or development. Hence, in RStudio, the intended workflow will have you do everything in one window, and the four panes make this workflow more efficient (in theory, at least). 0.5.3 What do the four panes do? Note that the following descriptions apply to the default layout. You can change the orientation and content of the panes (although you must always have four). Source Pane: Located in the top left quadrant. This pane is also called the “Editor”, because this is where we edit scripts. We will usually type our code in the source pane. Console Pane: Located in the bottom left quadrant. This pane is for direct communication with R. We can type commands here that are immediately evaluated (whereas the commands in a script are only evaluated when we explicitly run them). Furthermore, all output from the R commands that we run (either via the console or a script) is printed in the console pane. The two panes on the right side of the window contain various tabs. Two of these tabs are especially useful. Environment Tab: Located in the upper right quadrant The environment tab contains all the ‘objects’ currently loaded in your R session. You can always check what objects are loaded under the environment tab. The ‘environment’ is also called the ‘workspace’ Plots Tab: Located in the lower right quadrant The plots tab shows any graphs and figures we draw via R commands. If you zoom by clicking the magnifying glass icon, you can see enlarged versions of the plots.

One advantage of using RStudio projects is that the project directory is automatically set as the working directory.

"],["loading-data.html", "0.7 Loading data", " 0.7 Loading data Statistical analysis cannot happen without data. In R, you can load data in various ways. Let’s go over a couple of these. To complete the following exercise, first download the LifeSat.sav data. 0.7.1 Via clicky-box options Click through the following menu options: File &gt; Import Dataset Choose the type of dataset. For this exercise, the data are stored as an SPSS .sav file. Thus, select the From SPSS option. You may encounter an Install Required Packages pop-up dialog with a message that asks you whether you want to install the haven package. A package is an a piece of add-on software for R. To do most analyses, you will need some packages above-and-beyond the Base R software. In this case, haven contains functions that allow R to read SPSS data files. Click ‘Yes’ to install the package. At this point, the Import Statistical Data pop-up dialog should appear. Provide the location of your data file in the File/URL field. You can type the file path directly. You can also click Browse to find the file via a GUI interface. You should now see your data in the Data Preview area. In the Import Options section, you can set the name and format of your data file. All of your your selections are being translated to the R-code required to load your file. In the Code Preview area, the steps required to load the data with your selected options are expressed in terms of code. Finally, click Import at the lower right side of the window to load your data. 0.7.2 Via R code Of course, we don’t have to use tedious clicky-box processes. Once you get more familiar with R, it will be much easier to load data with R code. For this exercise, we will use the read.spss() function from the foreign package. Copy the following code into an R-script. Note that this code assumes you have saved your data in the working directory (this is the project directory if you’re using an R project). Otherwise, you will need to specify the file path to your data file as the first argument. library(foreign) LifeSat &lt;- read.spss(&quot;LifeSat.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE, use.value.labels = FALSE) To run the code: Place your cursor on the first line of code. Press the Ctrl/Cmd + Enter keys together. The code should now be evaluated by R, and R will tell you the result of its actions in the console pane. 0.7.2.1 Data frames When we read data into R, the data are most often stored as a special type of object called a data frame. Data frames are the preferred way to handle data in R. Data frames can hold variables with different types (e.g., a numeric depression rating, a categorical grouping factor representing employment status, and a character string recording the response to an open-ended question). The option to.data.frame = TRUE in the read.spss() call above loads the data into a data frame. 0.7.3 From Excel files We can also load data that are stored in Excel files. One way to do so is via the readxl package. ## Load the package: library(readxl) ## Read the first sheet of &#39;LifeSat.xlsx&#39; into &#39;LifeSat&#39;: LifeSat &lt;- read_excel(&quot;LifeSat.xlsx&quot;, sheet = 1) "],["exploring-data-via-r-functions.html", "0.8 Exploring data via R functions", " 0.8 Exploring data via R functions If you look a bit more closely at the R code that we used to load the data, you will see two special commands: library() and read.spss(). These commands are called functions. Any R command that is written as a name followed by parentheses, e.g., mean(), is a function. Functions are the driving force behind all R-based data analysis. Functions tell R to perform a specific (potentially very complicated) task. Rather than having to write out along sequence of commands every time we want to do some task, we can simply call the appropriate function. When using functions, you need to provide appropriate inputs to specify the behavior of the function and give the function data on which to operate. These inputs are called function arguments. Let’s explore three new functions and their arguments. These functions can help us understand our data. 0.8.1 head() Our data comprise many rows. We can use the head() function to inspect the first several rows. To use the head() function, you only need to provide one argument: The name of the dataset. ## Inspect the first several rows head(LifeSat) “Wait, what is the hash tag (#) doing there?” Don’t be surprised. The hash tag creates a “comment”. I.e., a bit of text that will not be evaluated by R. Comments let us write notes to explain what a particular piece of code does. Comments are doubly useful. They can help others understand your code. They can also help you remember what the code does after some time away. Copy the preceding code into your R script and run it. If all went well, R should now show the first six rows of the dataset in the console. 0.8.2 str() We frequently want to know something about the types of variables in a dataset. For example, if you want to run an analysis of variance (ANOVA), the independent variable(s) should be categorical. In R, these variables would be represented by a special type of variable called a factor. Before running our analysis, we should check if are data satisfy this requirement. We can use the str() function to get some information about the structure of an R object (str is an abbreviation of structure). To run the str() function, you only need to provide one argument: the name of the dataset. ## Inspect the structure of the dataset str(LifeSat) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 98 obs. of 8 variables: ## $ LifSat : num 13 18 19 24 24 24 30 33 33 33 ... ## $ age : num 75 75 72 72 70 73 72 72 68 73 ... ## $ educ : num 6 5 5 6 5 6 6 5 7 6 ... ## $ gender : num 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;value.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:2] &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;male&quot; &quot;female&quot; ## $ female : num 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 ... ## $ ChildSup: num 4 6 6 6 6 8 8 7 4 8 ... ## $ SpouSup : num 2 5 5 4 5 6 4 6 2 8 ... ## $ SES : num 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;value.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:3] &quot;3&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:3] &quot;high SES&quot; &quot;middle SES&quot; &quot;low SES&quot; ## - attr(*, &quot;variable.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:8] &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;Years of education&quot; &quot;&quot; ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:8] &quot;LifSat&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;educ&quot; &quot;gender&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;codepage&quot;)= int 1252 According to the output printed to the console, the LifeSat dataset is a data frame consisting of 98 observations of 8 variables. I.e., our dataset has 98 rows and 8 columns. We also get information about the contents of each column. For the fist column, we see $ LifSat : num 13 18 19 24 24 24 30 33 33 33 ... The LifSat variable is numeric (abbreviated as num). 13 is the value in the first row, 18 is the value in the second row, 19 is the value in the third row, and so on. 0.8.3 summary() We can get the descriptive statistics of the variables in a dataset with the summary() function. Again, we only need to provide one argument: the name of the dataset. summary(LifeSat) ## LifSat age educ gender ## Min. : 13.00 Min. :64.00 Min. : 4.000 Min. :1.000 ## 1st Qu.: 44.25 1st Qu.:68.25 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.:1.000 ## Median : 58.00 Median :70.00 Median : 6.000 Median :1.000 ## Mean : 57.86 Mean :70.26 Mean : 6.541 Mean :1.449 ## 3rd Qu.: 69.75 3rd Qu.:72.00 3rd Qu.: 7.000 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :100.00 Max. :75.00 Max. :12.000 Max. :2.000 ## female ChildSup SpouSup SES ## Min. :0.000 Min. : 3.000 Min. : 2.000 Min. :1.000 ## 1st Qu.:0.000 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.: 5.000 1st Qu.:1.000 ## Median :1.000 Median : 7.000 Median : 6.000 Median :2.000 ## Mean :0.551 Mean : 6.857 Mean : 6.061 Mean :1.918 ## 3rd Qu.:1.000 3rd Qu.: 8.000 3rd Qu.: 8.000 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :1.000 Max. :10.000 Max. :10.000 Max. :3.000 Run the above code and check the output in the console.

"],["tutorialPlotting.html", "0.9 Plotting data", " 0.9 Plotting data It is almost always a good idea to visualize your data before you dive into a full statistical analysis. For example, you may like to know something about the nature of the relationship between two specific variables, the distribution of some set of values, etc. In this section, we will create three basic plots of our data. When we create these plots, the figures will appear in the plots tab in the lower right quadrant of the RStudio window. 0.9.1 R packages and ggplot2 We will use the ggplot2 package for plotting. This package is not part of the Base R installation. So, you must install ggplot2 yourself (you should have already done so in Section 0.2.3). You only need to install an R package once. R packages are just small software programs, so they must be installed just like any other piece of software. After installing, the package is accessible on your computer but not yet available for use in your current R session. You must first load the package. You need to load the package every time you want to use it in a new R session. After loading, the package contents (i.e., functions, help files, datasets) are initialized in memory and ready to use in your current R session. Loading a package is more-or-less equivalent to ‘opening’ a software program by clicking on its desktop icon. Run the following code to load the ggplot2 package. library(ggplot2) 0.9.2 Histogram We can use a histogram to visualize how the values of a continuous variable are distributed. ## Use the &#39;LifeSat&#39; data to create the plot ## Use the &#39;LifeSat$LifSat&#39; variable to define the X-axis ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat)) + geom_histogram() # Create a histogram from the data/variable defined above 0.9.3 Boxplot A boxplot provides another useful visualization of a continuous variable’s distribution. We can also use boxplots to detect outliers. ## Same data/variable setup as above: ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat)) + geom_boxplot() # Create a boxplot 0.9.4 Scatterplot A scatterplot provides a visual representation of the relationship between two variables. Since we are now plotting two variables, we need to define a y variable in addition to thex variable specified in the previous examples. ## Add the &#39;age&#39; variable on the Y-axis: ggplot(data = LifeSat, aes(x = LifSat, y = age)) + geom_point() # Create a scatterplot "],["manipulating-data.html", "0.10 Manipulating Data", " 0.10 Manipulating Data 0.10.1 Data types Recall the output of the str() function. One piece of information contained therein is the type of data stored in each column of our dataset. There a different abbreviations signifying different types of data. Abbreviation Type Description num Numeric All values are numbers (e.g., 1.02) chr Character All values are words log Logical Boolean flags: TRUE or FALSE factor Factor A special type of object with labels to represent the levels of a categorical variable 0.10.2 Factors Factors are a special type of data object that R uses to represent categorical variables. A factor is stored internally as a vector of integers where each group is represented by a different number. The groups also get descriptive labels. R knows that a factor is not numeric and will treat any factor as a nominal grouping variable for anlaysis. In the output from the str() function in 0.8.2, we see that the gender variable is stored as a numeric variable. You can confirm by running either of the following commands. is.numeric(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] TRUE class(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; The gender varible is a binary grouping variable, so it should be stored as a factor. To convert gender to a factor, we can use the factor() function. ## Convert &#39;gender&#39; to a factor: LifeSat$gender &lt;- factor(LifeSat$gender) ## Check the results: is.numeric(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] FALSE class(LifeSat$gender) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; str(LifeSat$gender) ## Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;: 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 ... We now see that gender has been converted to a factor with the levels “1” and “2”. We don’t have to settle for meaningless numeric labels, though. We can assign meaningful value labels by providing an appropriate input for the labels argument. ## Create a factor with meaningful labels: LifeSat$gender &lt;- factor(LifeSat$gender, labels = c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;)) ## Check the results: str(LifeSat$gender) ## Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;: 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 ... 0.10.3 Subsetting: Extracting one variable When working with data frames, we can extract a single variable (i.e., column) from the data using the dollar sign operator, $. As shown in the example below. # Extract the &#39;LifSat&#39; variable from &#39;LifeSat&#39;: LifeSat$LifSat ## [1] 13 18 19 24 24 24 30 33 33 33 33 33 35 35 37 37 41 41 41 ## [20] 43 43 43 44 44 44 45 47 48 48 48 50 51 51 52 53 53 53 53 ## [39] 54 55 55 56 56 56 57 58 58 58 58 58 58 59 59 60 61 61 63 ## [58] 63 63 65 66 67 67 67 67 68 68 68 69 69 69 69 69 70 70 70 ## [77] 71 72 74 74 76 77 77 78 78 79 79 79 81 81 82 83 85 86 87 ## [96] 91 99 100 In the above code, we ask R to extract the column named LifSat from the data frame named LifeSat. The result will be returned as another special type of object: a vector. 0.10.4 Subsetting: Extracting rows and columns We can also extract rectangular subsets of a data frame using the following convention: my_data_frame[row_numbers, column_numbers]. ## Extract the first four rows of the first two columns: LifeSat[1:4, 1:2] By leaving either rows or columns empty, we get all rows or columns: ## Extract all rows of first two columns: LifeSat[ , 1:2] ## Extract all columns of first two rows: LifeSat[1:2, ] We can refer to the columns by name, too: LifeSat[1:2, c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;educ&quot;)] 0.10.5 Subsetting based on logical conditions We can also select rows or columns that satisfy logical conditions. In the following code, we select only the rows for which LifeSat$age is greater than 70. LifeSat[LifeSat$age &gt; 70, ] This approach works for any valid logical expression that will flag rows (or columns). Below, we select only the males and save the subset as a new object, LifeSat_male. LifeSat_male &lt;- LifeSat[LifeSat$gender == &quot;Male&quot;, ] str(LifeSat_male) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 44 obs. of 8 variables: ## $ LifSat : num 13 18 19 24 24 33 33 35 35 37 ... ## $ age : num 75 75 72 72 73 72 72 68 71 68 ... ## $ educ : num 6 5 5 6 6 5 12 6 4 7 ... ## $ gender : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... ## $ female : num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ ChildSup: num 4 6 6 6 8 7 5 6 7 4 ... ## $ SpouSup : num 2 5 5 4 6 6 6 6 7 4 ... ## $ SES : num 3 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 ... ## - attr(*, &quot;variable.labels&quot;)= Named chr [1:8] &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;Years of education&quot; &quot;&quot; ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:8] &quot;LifSat&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;educ&quot; &quot;gender&quot; ... ## - attr(*, &quot;codepage&quot;)= int 1252 0.10.6 Changing cell values We can easily overwrite values in a dataset using the same type of subsetting operations shown above in combination with the assignment operator, &lt;-. The following code will extract the 5th entry in the LifSat variable. LifeSat[5, &quot;LifSat&quot;] ## [1] 24 Actually, it’s not really accurate to say that the above code “extracts” any value. The above command creates a new temporary object containing only the relevant value and prints the contents of that object to the console. All the subsetting examples above (other than the selection of all males) have done something similar. Rather than thinking about the [] or $ selection operators as ways of extracting pieces of a data object, it’s more appropriate to think about these operators as selecting, highlight, activating, nominating (or some other such concept) the referenced elements. Once the elements are so selected, we can also overwrite their original values. We only need to assign new values to the subset. To demonstrate, let’s overwrite the value selected above with 10. ## Overwrite the 5th &#39;LifSat&#39; value: LifeSat[5, &quot;LifSat&quot;] &lt;- 10 ## Check the result: LifeSat[5, &quot;LifSat&quot;] ## [1] 10 "],["getting-help.html", "0.11 Getting Help", " 0.11 Getting Help As you start to apply the techniques described in this guide, you will soon have questions that the guide does not answer. This section describes a few tips on how to get help answering these questions. Every function in R has documentation (i.e., a help file). To see this file in RStudio, select the name of the function in your script, and press F1, or run the command ? followed by the name of the function (e.g., ?aov). The second option works outside of RStudio, too. If you get stuck, start with Google. Typically, adding “R” to a search is enough to return relevant results (e.g., “exploratory factor analysis R”). Google is particularly useful for error messages. If you get an error message that you don’t understand, try googling it. Someone else has almost certainly been confused by the same message in the past, and there will be help somewhere on the web. If the error message isn’t in English, run Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = \"en\") and re-run the code that produced the error (you’re more likely to find help for English error messages.) If Google doesn’t help, try stackoverflow. Before posting your question, spend some time searching the site for an existing answer (active contributors really hate it when you ask a question that has already been answered on the site). Including [R] in your search string restricts your search to questions and answers that use R.

SKIP PAGES 322 - 327 Questions What are the differences between a “verbal model” and a “formal model”? As explained in the paragraph “A Brief Note on Statistical Models”, formal models are not the same as statistical models. Still, we can learn a lot from Smaldino’s approach. Write down three insights from this paper that you would like to apply to your statistical modeling during this course. Answers Q1: A verbal model can be non-specific about many things The level of analysis The definitions of its parts The relationships within the modeled system Verbal models can appear powerful and useful partly because they employ strategic ambiguity. Because verbal models are so vague, they can apparently explain many different phenomena, even contradictory ones (e.g., the Cubist chicken). A formal model, on the other hand, seeks to rigorously define its level of analysis, parts (variables), and relationships between these parts. Q2: You should define the level of analysis for your model You should clearly operationalize the parts (variables) and explicitly define the hypothesized relationships (causal, correlational, definitional) between these parts The act of formally defining our models is productive. We can test a well-defined model using data. We can discuss such a model among experts with relative consensus about what the model means, and we can improve it. These things are harder to do with vague verbal models. Every model imposes some violence upon reality. I.e., every model is wrong (but some are useful). Because a model is a simplification, by necessity, we leave out many factors. This simplification is a feature, not a bug. Models abstract away the uninteresting details (i.e., noise) of a phenomenon. Even models that are too simple to be interesting represent useful building-blocks to expand upon when creating more complex, interesting models. Data can be used to validate a model and to refine the model into a closer approximation of reality "],["formative-assessment.html", "1.3 Formative Assessment", " 1.3 Formative Assessment A formative assessment helps you judge your progress in the course and helps you address any blind spots in your understanding of the material.

What is the age range (youngest and oldest child)? Hint: Use tidySEM::descriptives() Click for explanation As in the take home exercises, you can use the descriptives() function from the tidySEM package to describe the data: library(tidySEM) descriptives(sesam) 1.5.1.4 What is the average gain in knowledge of numbers? What is the standard deviation of this gain? Hints: You will need to compute the gain and save the change score as a new object. You can then use the base-R functions mean() and sd() to do the calculations. Click for explanation Create a new variable that represents the difference between pre- and post-test scores on knowledge of numbers: sesam$ndif &lt;- sesam$postnumb - sesam$prenumb Compute the mean and SD of the change score: mean(sesam$ndif) ## [1] 9.158333 sd(sesam$ndif) ## [1] 9.682401 1.5.1.5 Create an appropriate visualization of the gain scores you computed in 1.5.1.4. Justify your choice of visualization. Hint: Some applicable visualizations are explained in 0.9. Click for explanation library(ggplot2) ## Create an empty baseline plot object: p &lt;- ggplot(sesam, aes(x = ndif)) ## Add some appropriate geoms: p + geom_histogram() p + geom_density() p + geom_boxplot() 1.5.1.6 Create a visualization that provides information about the bivariate relationship between two of the variables. Justify your choice of visualization. Hint: Again, Section 0.9 may provide some useful insights. Click for explanation ## Create a scatterplot of the pre- and post-test number knowledge ggplot(sesam, aes(x = prenumb, y = postnumb)) + geom_point() 1.5.2 Part 2: Regression Analysis 1.5.2.1 Are there significant, bivariate associations between postnumb and the following variables? age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody Use Pearson correlations to answer this question. You do not need to check the assumptions here (though you would in real life). Hint: The base-R cor.test() function and the corr.test() function from the psych package will both conduct hypothesis tests for a correlation coefficients (the base-R cor() function only computes the coefficients). Click for explanation library(psych) ## Test the correlations using psych::corr.test(): corr.test( sesam[ , c(&quot;postnumb&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;prelet&quot;, &quot;prenumb&quot;, &quot;prerelat&quot;, &quot;peabody&quot;)] ) ## Call:corr.test(x = sesam[, c(&quot;postnumb&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;prelet&quot;, &quot;prenumb&quot;, ## &quot;prerelat&quot;, &quot;peabody&quot;)]) ## Correlation matrix ## postnumb age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody ## postnumb 1.00 0.34 0.50 0.68 0.54 0.52 ## age 0.34 1.00 0.33 0.43 0.44 0.29 ## prelet 0.50 0.33 1.00 0.72 0.47 0.40 ## prenumb 0.68 0.43 0.72 1.00 0.72 0.61 ## prerelat 0.54 0.44 0.47 0.72 1.00 0.56 ## peabody 0.52 0.29 0.40 0.61 0.56 1.00 ## Sample Size ## [1] 240 ## Probability values (Entries above the diagonal are adjusted for multiple tests.) ## postnumb age prelet prenumb prerelat peabody ## postnumb 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## age 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prelet 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prenumb 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## prerelat 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## peabody 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## ## To see confidence intervals of the correlations, print with the short=FALSE option ## OR ## ## Test the correlations using multiple cor.test() calls: cor.test(sesam$postnumb, sesam$age) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sesam$postnumb and sesam$age ## t = 5.5972, df = 238, p-value = 5.979e-08 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2241066 0.4483253 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.3410578 cor.test(sesam$postnumb, sesam$prelet) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sesam$postnumb and sesam$prelet ## t = 8.9986, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4029239 0.5926632 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5038464 cor.test(sesam$postnumb, sesam$prenumb) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sesam$postnumb and sesam$prenumb ## t = 14.133, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.6002172 0.7389277 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.6755051 cor.test(sesam$postnumb, sesam$prerelat) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sesam$postnumb and sesam$prerelat ## t = 9.9857, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4475469 0.6268773 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5433818 cor.test(sesam$postnumb, sesam$peabody) ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: sesam$postnumb and sesam$peabody ## t = 9.395, df = 238, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.4212427 0.6067923 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.520128 1.5.2.2 Do age and prenumb explain a significant proportion of the variance in postnumb? What statistic did you use to justify your conclusion? Interpret the model fit. Hints: The lm() function (short for linear model) estimates linear regression models. The summary() function provides relevant summary statistics for the model. Click for explanation results &lt;- lm(postnumb ~ age + prenumb, data = sesam) summary(results) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = postnumb ~ age + prenumb, data = sesam) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -38.130 -6.456 -0.456 5.435 22.568 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

We use the F statistic for the overall test of model fit to support this conclusion. The variables age and prenumb together explain 45.9% of the variability in postnumb. 1.5.2.3 Write the null and alternative hypotheses for tested in 1.5.2.2. Click for explanation Since we are testing for explained variance, our hypotheses concern the \\(R^2\\). \\[ \\begin{align*} H_0: R^2 = 0\\\\ H_1: R^2 &gt; 0 \\end{align*} \\] Note that this is a directional hypotheses because the \\(R^2\\) cannot be negative. 1.5.2.4 Consider the path model below. How many regression coefficients are estimated in this model? How many variances are estimated? How many covariances are estimated? How many degrees of freedom does this model have? Hint: As you learned in Lecture 1, \\(df = N_{obs} – N_{par}\\). 1.5.2.5 Consider a multiple regression analysis with three continuous independent variables: scores on tests of language, history, and logic, and one continuous dependent variable: score on a math test. We want to know if scores on the language, history, and logic tests can predict the math test score. Sketch a path model that you could use to answer this question How many regression parameters are there? How many variances could you estimate? How many covariances could you estimate? How many degrees of freedom does this model have? 1.5.3 Part 3: ANOVA 1.5.3.1 Load the Drivers.sav data. # Read the data into a data frame named &#39;drivers&#39;: drivers &lt;- read.spss(&quot;Drivers.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE) In this section, we will use ANOVA to evaluate the following research question: Does talking on the phone interfere with people’s driving skills? These data come from an experiment. The condition variable represents the three experimental conditions: Hand-held phone Hands-free phone Control (no phone) We will use condition as the IV in our ANOVA models. The DV, RT, represents the participant’s reaction time (in milliseconds) during a driving simulation. ANOVA vs. Linear Regression As you may know, the mathematical model underlying ANOVA is just a linear regression model with nominal IVs. So, in terms of the underlying statistical models, there is no difference between ANOVA and regression; the differences lie in the focus of the analysis. ANOVA is really a type of statistical test wherein we are testing hypotheses about the effects of some set of nominal grouping factors on some continuous outcome. When doing an ANOVA, we usually don’t interact directly with the parameter estimates from the underlying model. Regression is a type of statistical model (i.e., a way to represent a univariate distribution with a conditional mean and fixed variance). When we do a regression analysis, we primarily focus on the estimated parameters of the underling linear model. When doing ANOVA in R, we estimate the model exactly as we would for linear regression; we simply summarize the results differently. 1.5.3.2 Perform the ANOVA to test the above research question. Hint: After estimating the model with lm(), you can use the anova() function to compute the sums-of-squares and significance tests for each factor in your model. Click for explanation ## Estimate the underlying model: results &lt;- lm(RT ~ condition, data = drivers) ## Summarize the model as a regression analysis: summary(results) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = RT ~ condition, data = drivers) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -317.50 -71.25 2.98 89.55 243.45 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

In particular, we should probably check at least three conditions: There are no overly influential cases The residual variance is homogonous across groups The residuals are normally distributed 1.5.3.3 Check for influential cases. Hint: You can use the cooks.distance() function to compute Cook’s Distance statistic for each observation. Observations with Cook’s D values substantially larger than, and qualitatively distinct from, the rest of the data may be overly influential. You can evaluate the relative sizes of the distances by making an index plot of the estimated distance statistics. Click for explanation ## Compute the Cook&#39;s distances: d &lt;- cooks.distance(results) ## Plot the distances: plot(d) In the figure above, we’re looking for any distances that clearly “stand out from the crowd”. None of the distances in the above figure look notable. We do not see evidence of influential observations. 1.5.3.4 Check the normality of the residuals. Hints: One of the best ways to check the normality of residuals is with a Normal QQplot. We can easily create a Normal QQ-Plot of the residuals by plotting the results object from 1.5.3.2. Click for explanation plot(results, 2) In the QQ-Plot created above, we want to see all of the points follow the diagonal, dashed line. Perfectly normal residuals will fall exactly along this line Deviations away from the line indicate devations from normality. The residuals in this figure look quite good. We only see very minor deviations from the idealized line. The residuals appear to be more-or-less normally distributed. 1.5.3.5 Check the homogeneity of the residual variances. Hints: A scale-location plot is one of the best ways to check the homogeneity of variances assumption. Plot an estimate of the residual variance against the predicted values Any trend indicates differences in residual variance between groups Plotting the results object from 1.5.3.2 will also produce a scale-location plot. Click for explanation plot(results, 3) The red line in this figure is a loess line which represents the trend of the plotted data. If this loess line is flat, there is no evidence of differences in the residual variances between groups. Trends in this line indicate violations of the homogeneity assumption. In this case, the line is pretty much flat and we have little-to-no evidence of heterogeneous residual variances. 1.5.3.6 Summarize your conclusions regarding the assumption. Are the assumptions satisfied? Can we trust the model results? Click for explanation There are no observations that stand out as particularly influential. Furthermore, we have no evidence of heterogeneous residual variances or substantial violations of normality for the residuals. Hence, the assumptions appear to be satisfied, and we can trust the conclusions of our analysis. 1.5.3.7 Use your results to answer the research question. Click for explanation anova(results) The effect of condition on RT was nonsignificant (\\(F[2, 57] = 3.07\\), \\(p = 0.054\\)). Therefore, based on these results, we do not have evidence for an effect of mobile phone usage on driving performance. 1.5.4 Part 4: ANCOVA We will now conduct an ANCOVA to assess the following research question. Are there differences in reaction times between the phone conditions after controlling for age? As with ANOVA, the statistical model underlying an ANCOVA is simply a linear regression model. The model for an ANCOVA, however, includes at least one continuous covariate in addition to the categorical IVs. Consequently, when we conduct ANCOVA in R, we again use the lm() function to estimate the model. 1.5.4.1 Estimate the ANCOVA model needed to test the above research question. Click for explanation ## Estimate the model: results &lt;- lm(RT ~ condition + age, data = drivers) ## Conduct the statistical tests: anova(results) ANCOVA and Interactions As you can see above, when we run an ANCOVA, we’re just estimating a multiple linear regression model. We call the analysis ANCOVA because we are interested in a specific hypothesis. Our substantive interest lies in the categorical IVs. The continuous covariates are uninteresting, nuisance variables that we are controlling for to get better estimates of the interesting treatment effects. One implication of this hypothesis is the absence of any interaction between the covariates and grouping factors. If the covariate moderates the treatment effect, the covariate has a direct impact on the substantively interesting group differences. Such a covariate is not a covariate; it’s a substantively integral feature of the model. If we want to report our analysis as an ANCOVA, we need to show that the covariate effects are equivalent in each group. In other words, there is no interaction between the grouping factors and the covariates. 1.5.4.2 Test for an interaction between age and condition in the model from 1.5.4.1. What is your conclusion? Can we report our analysis as an ANCOVA? Hint: You can include an interaction term in an R formulas ‘multiplying’ the two variable names using the * operator. Click for explanation ## Add the interaction between &#39;age&#39; and &#39;condition&#39; to the model: results_int &lt;- lm(RT ~ condition * age, data = drivers) ## Conduct the hypothesis tests. anova(results_int) The interaction between condition and age is not significant (\\(F[2, 54] = 1.07\\), \\(p = 0.349\\)). Therefore, the covariate effects should be more-or-less equivalent in each group, and we can report our analysis as an ANCOVA. 1.5.4.3 Answer the research from above question. If you did find a significant, partial effect of condition, do a post hoc comparison of pairwise mean differences to see which groups showed significantly different reaction times, after controlling for age. Use Tukey’s HSD correction for all pairwise comparisons to control the Type I error rate. Hints: You can conduct the appropriate post hoc test with the TukeyHSD() function. The TukeyHSD() function only works on models estimated using the aov() function (which is the same as lm() but summarizes the results in ANOVA style). To satisfy TukeyHSD(), you can either rerun your model with aov() or convert your results object to the correct format via aov(results). Click for explanation ## Check the hypothesis tests for the ANCOVA from above: anova(results) ## Run the post hoc comparisons: TukeyHSD(aov(results)) ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = results) ## ## $condition ## diff lwr upr p adj ## hands-free-hand-held -36.95 -118.5708 44.67082 0.5242511 ## control-hand-held -100.75 -182.3708 -19.12918 0.0119407 ## control-hands-free -63.80 -145.4208 17.82082 0.1533777 After controlling for age, phone usage significantly affects driving performance (\\(F[2, 56] = 4.52\\), \\(p = 0.015\\)). Specifically, the hand-held condition has a significant higher reaction time than the control condition. 1.5.5 Part 5: Back to Regression As we saw above, we can use ANOVA or ANCOVA to test hypotheses about differences between groups in some continuous outcome. AN(C)OVA is a type of statistical test, though, not a type of model. The statistical model underlying an AN(C)OVA is just a linear regression model. Since this class is about statistical modeling, it won’t do us much good to keep thinking in terms of statistical tests; we’re better off approaching these problems from a modeling perspective. We can just as easily make the inferences from above by working directly within a regression modeling framework. In this section, we will explore linear regression models with categorical predictors. 1.5.5.1 Load the Sesam2.sav data. # Read the data into an object called &#39;sesam2&#39;: sesam2 &lt;- read.spss(&quot;Sesam2.sav&quot;, to.data.frame = TRUE) 1.5.5.2 VIEWCAT is a nominal grouping variable, but it is represented as a numeric variable in the sesam2 data. Convert VIEWCAT into a factor. Make sure that VIEWCAT = 1 is the reference group. Hints: You can identify the reference group with the levels() or contrasts() functions. The reference group is the group labelled with the first level printed by levels(). When you run contrasts(), you will see a pattern matrix that defines a certain dummy coding scheme. The reference group is the group that has zeros in each column of this matrix. If you need to change the reference group, you can use the relevel() function. Click for explanation ## Convert &#39;VIEWCAT&#39; to a factor: sesam2$VIEWCAT &lt;- factor(sesam2$VIEWCAT) ## Check the reference group: levels(sesam2$VIEWCAT) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; contrasts(sesam2$VIEWCAT) ## 2 3 4 ## 1 0 0 0 ## 2 1 0 0 ## 3 0 1 0 ## 4 0 0 1 1.5.5.3 Estimate a multiple regression model wherein VIEWCAT predicts POSTNUMB. Summarize the model. Interpret the estimates.

Color the points according to the their VIEWCAT level. Save the plot object to a variable in your environment. Hint: You can map color to the levels of a variable on your dataset by assigning the variable names to the color argument of the aes() function in ggplot(). Click for explanation library(ggplot2) ## Add aes(..., color = VIEWCAT) to get different colors for each group: p &lt;- ggplot(sesam2, aes(x = AGE, y = POSTNUMB, color = VIEWCAT)) + geom_point() # Add points for scatterplot ## Print the plot stored as &#39;p&#39;: p We assigned the global color aesthetic to the VIEWCAT variable, so the points are colored based on their group. 1.5.5.5 Add linear regression lines for each group to the above scatterplot. Hints: You can add regression lines with ggplot2::geom_smooth() To get linear regression lines, set the argument method = \"lm\" To omit error envelopes, set the argument se = FALSE Click for explanation ## Add OLS best-fit lines: p + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) The global color aesthetic assignment from above carries through to any additional plot elements that we add, including the regression lines. So, we also get a separate regression line for each VIEWCAT group. 1.5.5.6 How would you interpret the pattern of regression lines above? Click for explanation All the lines show a positive slope, so post-test number recognition appears to increase along with increasing age. The lines are not parallel, though. So, VIEWCAT may be moderating the effect of AGE on POSTNUMB. Moderated Regression Based on the figure we just created, we may want to test for moderation in our regression model. To do so, we need to add an interaction between AGE and VIEWCAT. The VIEWCAT factor is represented by 3 in our model, though. So, when we interact AGE and VIEWCAT, we will create 3 interaction terms. To test the overall moderating influence of VIEWCAT, we need to conduct a multiparameter hypothesis test of all 3 interaction terms. One way that we can go about implementing such a test is through a hierarchical regression analysis entailing three steps: Estimate the additive model wherein we regress POSTNUMB onto AGE and VIEWCAT without any interaction. Estimate the moderated model by adding the interaction between AGE and VIEWCAT into the additive model. Conduct a \\(\\Delta R^2\\) test to compare the fit of the two models. 1.5.5.7 Conduct the hierarchical regression analysis described above. Does VIEWCAT significantly moderate the effect of AGE on POSTNUMB? Provide statistical justification for your conclusion.

Compare the result to the anova() output from 1.5.5.7. What do you notice when comparing the two anova() outputs? Does this comparison offer any insight into the relation between regression and AN(C)OVA? Click for explanation anova(results_mod) anova(results_add, results_mod) When we run the anova() function on only the moderated regression model, we get ANCOVA-style tests like those we used in 1.5.4.2. The marginal test for the interaction between AGE and VIEWCAT in this ANCOVA-style result is identical to the model comparison test from 1.5.5.7. This comparison shows that the significance tests for marginal effects in an AN(C)OVA model can be equivalent to certain model comparison tests in a regression model. Indeed, although you cannot know this from only the examples explored here, any significance test in an AN(C)OVA can be reformulated as a comparison between two appropriately nested linear regression models.

"],["lecture-1.html", "2.1 Lecture", " 2.1 Lecture Download slides How do you know if you have measured the putative hypothetical construct that you intend to measure? The methods introduced in this lecture (namely, latent variables, factor analysis, and reliability analysis) can shed empirical light on this issue. In the social and behavioral sciences we’re often forced to measure key concepts indirectly. For example, we have no way of directly quantifying a person’s current level of depression, or their innate motivation, or their risk-aversion, or any of the other myriad psychological features that comprise the human mental state. In truth, we cannot really measure these hypothetical constructs at all, we must estimate latent representations thereof (though, psychometricians still use the language of physical measurement to describe this process). Furthermore, we can rarely estimate an adequate representation with only a single observed variable (e.g., question on a survey, score on a test, reading from a sensor). We generally need several observed variables to reliably represent a single hypothetical construct. For example, we cannot accurately determine someone’s IQ or socio-economic status based on their response to a single question; we need several questions that each tap into slightly different aspects of IQ or SES. Given multiple items measuring the same construct, we can use the methods discussed in this lecture (i.e., factor analysis and reliability analysis) to evaluate the quality of our measurement (i.e., how well we have estimated the underlying hypothetical construct). If we do well enough in this estimation task, we will be able to combine these estimated latent variables with the path analysis methods discussed in two weeks to produce the full structural equation models that we will cover at the end of this course.

Click for explanation In keeping with conventions, we will treat ordinal Likert-type rating scales with five or more levels as continuous. Consequently, we need to convert these variables from factors to numeric vectors. We can convert a factor to a numeric variable using the as.numeric() function, but this function only operates on one variable at a time. To replicate the Kestilä (2006) analysis, we need to convert 37 variables. Thankfully, we can use apply functions to broadcast univariate operation across each column (or row) of a dataset. We are specifically interested in the lapply() function. The lapply() function applies some function to each element in a list (e.g., each column in a data frame). The variables we care about live in columns 7 to 44 of the ess dataset. In the following code, we apply the as.numeric() function to these columns and overwrite their original factor versions with the converted numeric data. ess[7:44] &lt;- lapply(ess[7:44], as.numeric) In addition to screening with summary statistics, we can also visualize the variables’ distributions. You have already created a few such visualizations for single variables. Now, we will use a few tricks to efficiently plot each of our target variables. The first step in this process will be to convert the interesting part of our data from “wide format” (one column per variable) into “long format” (one column of variable names, one column of data values). The pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package provides a convenient way to execute this conversion. 2.4.5 Use tidyr::pivot_longer() to create a long-formatted data frame from the target variables in ess (i.e., columns 7 to 44). Click for explanation ## Load the tidyr package: library(tidyr) ## Convert the target variables into a long-formatted data frame: ess_plot &lt;- pivot_longer(ess[7:44], colnames(ess)[7:44]) The next step in the process will be to plot the variables using ggplot(). To create one plot for each variable, we will use the facet_wrap() function to facet the plots on the ess_plot$name column (i.e., create a separate conditional plot for each unique value in ess_plot$name). 2.4.6 Use ggplot() with an appropriate geom (e.g., geom_histogram(), geom_density(), geom_boxplot()) and facet_wrap() to visualize each of the target variables. Hint: To implement the faceting, simply add facet_wrap(~ name, scales = \"free_x\") to the end of your ggplot() call. Click for explanation library(ggplot2) ggplot(ess_plot, aes(x = value)) + geom_histogram() + # Create a histogram facet_wrap(~ name, scales = &quot;free_x&quot;) # Facet on &#39;name&#39; Notice that the variables are actually discrete (i.e., each variable takes only a few integer values). However, most variables look relatively normal despite being categorical. So, it’s probably fine to analyze these variables as continuous. 2.4.7 Check the descriptives for the target variables again. Do you see any remaining issues? Click for explanation descriptives(ess[7:44]) No. Everything looks pretty much fine. Now, we’re ready to run the analyses and see if we can replicate the Kestilä (2006) results. 2.4.8 Run two principal component analyses (PCA): one for trust in politics, one for attitudes towards immigration. Use the principal() function from the psych package. Use exactly the same specifications as Kestilä (2006) concerning the estimation method, rotation, number of components extracted, etc. Hints: Remember that you can view the help file for psych::principal() by running ?psych::principal or, if the psych package already loaded, simply running ?principal. When you print the output from psych::principal(), you can use the cut option to hide any factor loadings smaller than a given threshold. You could consider hiding any loadings smaller than those reported by Kestilä (2006) to make the output easier to interpret.

PCA is a dimension reduction technique that distills the most salient information from a set of variables into a (smaller) set of component scores. Hence, PCA can be a good way of creating aggregate items (analogous to weighted scale scores) when the data are not collected with validated scales. Principal component scores are automatically generated when we run the PCA. If we want to use these scores in subsequent analyses (e.g., as predictors in a regression model), we usually add them to our dataset as additional columns. 2.4.9 Add the component scores produced by the analyses you ran above to the ess data frame. Give each component score an informative name, based on your interpretation of the factor loading matrix I.e., What hypothetical construct do you think each component represents given the items that load onto it? Hints: You can use the data.frame() function to join multiple objects into a single data frame. You can use the colnames() function to assign column names to a matrix or data frame. Click for explanation 1. Extract the component scores The object produced by psych::principal() is simply list, and the component scores are already stored therein. So, to extract the component scores, we simply use the $ operator to extract them. ## Save the component scores in stand-alone matrices: trust_scores &lt;- pca_trust$scores att_scores &lt;- pca_att$scores ## Inspect the result: head(trust_scores) ## RC3 RC2 RC1 ## 1 NA NA NA ## 4 0.09755193 -0.01552183 0.994954 ## 7 0.23069626 -1.53162604 -2.022642 ## 14 NA NA NA ## 17 -0.21112678 0.84370377 1.200007 ## 20 1.86596955 0.31083233 -1.062603 summary(trust_scores) ## RC3 RC2 RC1 ## Min. :-4.035 Min. :-3.706 Min. :-3.139 ## 1st Qu.:-0.527 1st Qu.:-0.652 1st Qu.:-0.649 ## Median : 0.155 Median : 0.094 Median : 0.092 ## Mean : 0.055 Mean : 0.015 Mean : 0.049 ## 3rd Qu.: 0.727 3rd Qu.: 0.742 3rd Qu.: 0.742 ## Max. : 3.302 Max. : 3.452 Max. : 3.539 ## NA&#39;s :4912 NA&#39;s :4912 NA&#39;s :4912 head(att_scores) ## RC2 RC1 RC5 RC3 RC4 ## 1 1.9920289 1.3140238 -0.8305392 -0.06329775 -0.08837693 ## 4 0.1708174 -1.2167781 -0.4974957 -0.23766146 0.67364069 ## 7 -0.3580985 0.3236336 -1.5094405 -0.53052720 -2.20637993 ## 14 NA NA NA NA NA ## 17 -0.1136716 -0.7869911 -1.4664715 -0.07112144 0.41078167 ## 20 -0.9188606 2.8264230 -0.3477484 -0.73788338 -1.32089442 summary(att_scores) ## RC2 RC1 RC5 RC3 ## Min. :-3.650 Min. :-3.909 Min. :-3.817 Min. :-2.730 ## 1st Qu.:-0.611 1st Qu.:-0.599 1st Qu.:-0.653 1st Qu.:-0.748 ## Median :-0.080 Median : 0.053 Median :-0.004 Median :-0.152 ## Mean :-0.007 Mean : 0.001 Mean : 0.023 Mean :-0.026 ## 3rd Qu.: 0.686 3rd Qu.: 0.644 3rd Qu.: 0.653 3rd Qu.: 0.620 ## Max. : 3.743 Max. : 4.495 Max. : 4.114 Max. : 3.869 ## NA&#39;s :5400 NA&#39;s :5400 NA&#39;s :5400 NA&#39;s :5400 ## RC4 ## Min. :-3.767 ## 1st Qu.:-0.682 ## Median : 0.045 ## Mean : 0.004 ## 3rd Qu.: 0.716 ## Max. : 3.248 ## NA&#39;s :5400 2.

Based on what you’ve learned from the readings and lectures, do you agree with this position? Click for information Hopefully not. PCA is not a method for estimating latent measurement structure; PCA is a dimension reduction technique that tries to summarize a set of data with a smaller set of component scores. If we really want to estimate the factor structure underlying a set of observed variables, we should use EFA. 2.5.3 Suppose you had to construct the trust in politics and attitude towards immigration scales described by Kestilä (2006) based on the theory and background information presented in that article. What type of analysis would you choose? What key factors would influence your decision? Click for information We are trying to estimate meaningful latent factors, so EFA would be an appropriate method. The theory presented by Kestilä (2006) did not hypothesize a particular number of factors, so we would need to use appropriate techniques to estimate the best number. In particular, combining information from: Scree plots Parallel analysis Substantive interpretability of the (rotated) factor loadings Since the factors are almost certainly correlated, we should apply an oblique rotation. We will now rerun the two PCAs that you conducted for the At-Home Exercises using EFA. We need to know how many factors to extract to estimate an EFA using the psych::fa() function. We could simply estimate a range of solutions and compare the results. We can restrict the range of plausible solutions and save some time by first checking/plotting the eigenvalues and running parallel analysis. 2.5.4 Estimate the number of latent factors underlying the Trust items based on the eigenvalues, the scree plot, and parallel analysis. How many factors are suggested by each method? Hints: You can estimate the eigenvalues of a data matrix with the eigen() function from Base-R. Check the Value section of the documentation for eigen() to find information on how to extract the eigenvalues. You can create a scree plot by supplying the vector of eigenvalues to the qplot() function from the ggplot2 package and applying the geom_path() geometry. Click for explanation First, we’ll run a trivial EFA using the psych::fa() function to get eigenvalues. We don’t care about the factors yet, so we can extract a single factor. We also don’t care about interpretable solutions, so we don’t need rotation. ## Load the psych package: library(psych) ## Run a trival EFA on the &#39;trust&#39; items efa_trust0 &lt;- fa(ess[7:19], nfactors = 1, rotate = &quot;none&quot;) We can check the eigenvalues to see what proportion of the observed variance is accounted for by each additional factor we may extract. round(efa_trust0$values, digits = 3) ## [1] 4.940 0.733 0.492 0.173 0.064 0.014 -0.066 -0.091 -0.195 -0.210 ## [11] -0.289 -0.307 -0.318 Since only one eigenvalue is greater than one, the so-called “Kaiser Criterion” would suggest extracting a single factor. The Kaiser Criterion is not a valid way to select the number of factors in EFA. So, we don’t want to rely on this information alone. We can still use the eigenvalues to help us with factor enumeration, though. One way to do so is by plotting the eigenvalues in a scree plot. We can easily create a scree plot by passing the eigenvalues to the qplot() function from the ggplot2 package and add apply the geom_path() geometry: library(ggplot2) qplot(y = efa_trust0$values) + geom_path() + ylab(&quot;Eigenvalues&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Factors&quot;) Although the scree plot provides useful information, we need to interpret that information subjectively, and the conclusions are sometimes ambiguous. In this case, the plot seems to suggest either one or three components, depending on where we consider the “elbow” to lie. As recommended in the lecture, we can also use “parallel analysis” (Horn, 1965) to provide more quantified information about the number of factors. We’ll use the psych::fa.parallel() function to implement parallel analysis. Parallel analysis relies on randomly simulated/permuted data, so we should set a seed to make sure our results are reproducible. We can set the fa = \"fa\" option to get only the results for EFA. ## Set the random number seed: set.seed(235711) ## Run the parallel analysis: pa_trust &lt;- fa.parallel(ess[7:19], fa = &quot;fa&quot;) ## Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 6 and the number of components = NA The results of the parallel analysis suggest 6 factors. If you’ve been paying close attention, you may have noticed that we need to compute the eigenvalues from the original data to run parallel analysis. Hence, we don’t actually need to run a separate EFA to estimate the eigenvalues. ## View the eigenvalues estimated during the parallel analysis: pa_trust$fa.values ## [1] 4.93985031 0.73335474 0.49174655 0.17294854 0.06372444 0.01363969 ## [7] -0.06605432 -0.09109183 -0.19535125 -0.20991379 -0.28855561 -0.30662420 ## [13] -0.31782296 ## Compare to the version from the EFA: pa_trust$fa.values - efa_trust0$values ## [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## Recreate the scree plot from above: qplot(y = pa_trust$fa.values) + geom_path() + ylab(&quot;Eigenvalues&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Factors&quot;) The different criteria disagree on how many factors we should extract, but we have narrowed the range. Based on the scree plot and parallel analysis, we should consider solutions for 3 to 6 factors. We need to examine the factor loadings to see which solution makes the most substantive sense. 2.5.5 Do the same analysis for the attitudes toward immigration items. Click for explanation This time, we’ll start by running the parallel analysis and get the eigenvalues from the object returned by psych::fa.parallel(). ## Set the seed: set.seed(235711) ## Run parallel analysis on the &#39;attitudes&#39; items: pa_att &lt;- fa.parallel(ess[20:44]) ## Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 7 and the number of components = 5 ## Check the eigenvalues: round(pa_att$fa.values, digits = 3) ## [1] 7.841 1.474 0.748 0.534 0.327 0.152 0.123 0.025 -0.033 -0.064 ## [11] -0.081 -0.098 -0.121 -0.137 -0.145 -0.179 -0.196 -0.204 -0.214 -0.222 ## [21] -0.246 -0.253 -0.331 -0.425 -0.432 ## Create a scree plot: qplot(y = pa_att$fa.values) + geom_path() + ylab(&quot;Eigenvalues&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Factors&quot;) For the attitudes toward immigration analysis, the results are even more ambiguous than they were for the trust items. The Kaiser Criterion suggests 2 factors The scree plot is hopelessly ambiguous At least 3 factors? No more than 9 factors? Parallel analysis suggests 7 factors Based on the scree plot and parallel analysis, it seems reasonable to consider solutions for 3 to 7 factors. Again, we need to check the substantive interpretation to choose the most reasonable solution. To perform EFA using the fa() function, we need to specify a few key options. The data (including only the variables you want to analyze) The number of factors that you want to extract The rotation method The estimation method The method of estimating factor scores 2.5.6 Apart from the number of factors, you also want to look at the factor loadings. They can be found in the “pattern matrix”. The higher the factor loadings are, the more indicative an item is for the latent factor. If you find some items to have only very low loadings (indicating that the items do not provide much information about the factor), you may choose not to include them in your analysis. This means you have to rerun the analysis under question 3. Click for explanation You can find the factor loadings by means of the ‘print’-function used in the take-home exercise, or you can search for the variable ‘loadings’, which is inside the results object, to end up with just the information you are searching for. ## Define an empty list to hold all of our fitted EFA objects: efa_trust &lt;- list() ## Loop through the interesting numbers of factors and estimate an EFA for each: for(i in 3:6) efa_trust[[i - 2]] &lt;- fa(ess[7:19], nfactors = i, # Number of factors = Loop index rotate = &quot;promax&quot;, # Oblique rotation scores = &quot;Bartlett&quot;) # Extimate factor scores with WLS ##

Below the matrix of loadings, we see a second matrix, which indicates (amongst other things) the proportion var: How much variance in the items is explained by each of the factors. Each subsequent factor explains slightly less variance than the ones before it (this is a property of exploratory factor analysis). The cumulative var indicates how much variance the factors explain, in total. If you estimated as many factors as items, then the last value for cumulative var would be 1.00 (100%). The factor loading matrix is slightly hard to read, due to the jumble of factor loadings. To create more clarity, it is convenient to suppress the factor loadings that are lower than .30. print(efa_trust$loadings, cut = .30, digits = 2) ## ## Loadings: ## MR3 MR1 MR2 ## pltcare 0.82 ## pltinvt 0.81 ## trstprl 0.41 0.38 ## trstlgl 0.84 ## trstplc 0.78 ## trstplt 0.57 ## trstep 0.50 ## trstun 0.54 ## stfeco 0.70 ## stfgov 0.59 ## stfdem 0.46 ## stfedu 0.70 ## stfhlth 0.66 ## ## MR3 MR1 MR2 ## SS loadings 2.18 2.10 2.02 ## Proportion Var 0.17 0.16 0.16 ## Cumulative Var 0.17 0.33 0.48 Furthermore, if you want to perform a factor analysis without, say, stfedu, while you want all other variables included in your factor analysis, you can simply leave the column number of stfedu, which is 13, out of the command: efa_trust_without_stfedu &lt;- fa(df[, c(7:12, 14:19)], nfactors = 3, rotate = &quot;promax&quot;, fm = &quot;ml&quot;) 2.5.7 Give the factor scores an appropriate name. You can do this by inspecting the items that load on one factor. What do these items have in common substantively? The goal of a factor analysis usually is to create interpretable factors. If you have trouble interpreting the factors, you can choose to tweak the analysis by changing the options, or including/excluding more items. Furthermore, after you named the factor scores accordingly, extract them from the results object and add them to the data.frame. Hint: If you do not know how to do this, have a look at question 1.h from the take-home exercise of week 2. Please note that the colnames will be specified from left to right, and not, for example, from ML1 to ML5. 2.5.8 The next step is to assert whether the items that together form one factor, also form a reliable scale. Run separate reliability analyses by means of the function alpha for the items that together form one factor, and evaluate Cronbach’s alpha to see whether the scales are internally consistent. The “Reliability if an item is dropped (alpha.drop)” information may be handy to inspect what would happen if you would delete one item; you can find it inside the reliability analysis object. If Cronbach’s alpha is not ok, deselect one survey item and run the analyses under question 4 and question 5 again. Hint: Cronbach’s alpha &gt; .7 are deemed to be ok, &gt; .8 is good. If Cronbach’s alpha is not ok, deselect one survey item and run the analyses under question 4 and question 5 again. Click for explanation If you want to assess the reliability of the variables pltcare, pltinvt, trstprl, trstplt, and trstep you can run a reliability analysis as follows. Hint: name the new objects substantively, instead of numbering them. reli_1 &lt;- psych::alpha(ess_with_scores[, c(7, 8, 9, 12, 13)]) reli_1 ## ## Reliability analysis ## Call: psych::alpha(x = ess_with_scores[, c(7, 8, 9, 12, 13)]) ## ## raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd median_r ## 0.8 0.83 0.82 0.49 4.8 0.0019 4.4 1.4 0.52 ## ## 95% confidence boundaries ## lower alpha upper ## Feldt 0.8 0.8 0.81 ## Duhachek 0.8 0.8 0.81 ## ## Reliability if an item is dropped: ## raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N alpha se var.r med.r ## pltcare 0.79 0.80 0.77 0.50 4.0 0.0021 0.017 0.52 ## pltinvt 0.80 0.81 0.78 0.51 4.2 0.0021 0.016 0.53 ## trstprl 0.73 0.78 0.76 0.47 3.6 0.0027 0.018 0.52 ## trstplt 0.70 0.75 0.73 0.43 3.1 0.0031 0.014 0.43 ## trstep 0.78 0.82 0.80 0.53 4.6 0.0021 0.010 0.52 ## ## Item statistics ## n raw.r std.r r.cor r.drop mean sd ## pltcare 17975 0.66 0.75 0.67 0.56 2.6 1.1 ## pltinvt 17971 0.64 0.74 0.65 0.54 2.4 1.1 ## trstprl 17753 0.84 0.80 0.74 0.69 6.3 2.3 ## trstplt 17966 0.88 0.86 0.83 0.77 5.3 2.2 ## trstep 16390 0.77 0.70 0.59 0.57 5.6 2.3 Sometimes, the table “Reliability if an item is dropped” will indicate that Cronbach’s alpha increases when you drop a variable out of the analysis. Note, however, that doing so is an exploratory approach to analysis, and it may make your work incomparable to other publications using the same scale. 2.5.9 Now you can analyze the differences between the factor scores for the PCA analysis (take-home exercise 2) and the EFA by plotting them in a series of scatterplots (bivariate) using ggplot2. The PCA factor scores are already stored in the dataset ESSround1-b.csv in columns 45 through 52 (df[, 45:52]). Plot the scores for one of your new factors on the x axis, and try to match it with a corresponding PCA component in the dataset. Note that if you went with a different number of factors than Kestilä’s components (5 for ‘trust in politics’ and 3 for ‘attitudes towards immigration’), you may find little correlation between any factors. Click for explanation Make sure to adjust the arguments x = EFA_trust1 and y = PCA_Trust1 to align with your own EFA factor column name and a PCA component column name from the data respectively library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = ess_with_scores) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = EFA_Trust1, y = PCA_Trust1)) 2.5.10 Examine the correlations between the PCA and EFA scales for the ‘trust in politics’ scores, and for the ‘immigration’ scores. What is your conclusion: is there a difference between them? Click for explanation Hint: Name the new objects substantively once again.

Attitudes towards immigration and 2. Political trust. Repeat her analyses using the factor scores you saved in step 5. Think about the statistical test you would like to use. Do you draw similar or different conclusions? Click for explanation We can use an ANOVA to test whether the countries differ in the amount of political trust the participants have. fit_ANOVA &lt;- aov(trustinstEFA ~ cntry, data = ess_with_scores) summary(fit_ANOVA) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## cntry 8 4730 591.2 637.3 &lt;2e-16 *** ## Residuals 14769 13700 0.9 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## 3409 observations deleted due to missingness In which trustinstEFA is the dependent variable, cntry is the grouping variable, and df is the name of the dataset; summary will provide the results. However, it will only indicate whether the variable cntry is significant or not, so you will be unable to tell which countries differ in terms of their political trust. To tell which countries differ, you can do a pairwise comparison test, with a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. pair_comparison &lt;- pairwise.t.test(ess_with_scores$trustinstEFA, ess_with_scores$cntry, p.adjust.method = &quot;bonf&quot;, na.rm = TRUE) round(pair_comparison$p.value, digits = 3) ## Austria Belgium Denmark Finland Germany Italy Netherlands Norway ## Belgium 0 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## Denmark 0 0 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## Finland 0 0 0.036 NA NA NA NA NA ## Germany 0 0 0.000 0 NA NA NA NA ## Italy 0 0 0.000 0 0 NA NA NA ## Netherlands 0 0 0.000 0 0 0 NA NA ## Norway 1 0 0.000 0 0 0 0 NA ## Sweden 0 0 0.000 0 0 0 1 0 2.5.12 The second goal of Kestilä is to show how socio-demographic characteristics affect attitudes towards immigrants and trust in politics in Finland. Select only the Finnish cases using the variable cntry. Click for explanation To select the Finnish cases only, select rows for which $cntry is equal to (==) Finland: ess_finland &lt;- ess_with_scores[ess_with_scores$cntry == &quot;Finland&quot;, ] After selecting the Finnish cases, we have to prepare our variables for analysis. Thanks to the factor analyses above, our dependent variables are taken care of. However, we should examine the independent variables to make sure there are no surprises, and do any recoding necessary before we can run multiple regression. The independent variables are c(\"gndr\", \"yrbrn\", \"eduyrs\", \"polintr\", \"lrscale\"). Click for explanation library(tidySEM) descriptives(ess_finland[, c(&quot;gndr&quot;, &quot;yrbrn&quot;, &quot;eduyrs&quot;, &quot;polintr&quot;, &quot;lrscale&quot;)]) Note that we still have to do some recoding. For example, the data contains participants’ year of birth instead of their age. We have to recode this variable. The data were collected in 2002, so we can simply subtract the year of birth of every participant from the year 2002. ess_finland$age &lt;- (2002 - ess_finland$yrbrn) Furthermore, the variables polintr and lrscale are currently coded as character variables. If you analyze them like that, R will make dummies for all distinct values on these variables. Let’s recode those, too! The main challenge is to get the levels of these variables in the correct order, and convert them to numbers. We demonstrate two ways to do this, one way for each of the two variables. For political interest, we convert the character variable to an ordered categorical variable, and we specify the correct order of labels. Then, we convert it to a numeric variable. table(ess_finland$polintr) ## ## Hardly interested Not at all interested Quite interested ## 842 228 785 ## Very interested ## 144 ess_finland$polintr &lt;- ordered(ess_finland$polintr, levels = c(&quot;Not at all interested&quot;, &quot;Hardly interested&quot;, &quot;Quite interested&quot;, &quot;Very interested&quot;)) table(ess_finland$polintr) ## ## Not at all interested Hardly interested Quite interested ## 228 842 785 ## Very interested ## 144 ess_finland$polintr &lt;- as.numeric(ess_finland$polintr) For political orientation, only the two extreme values of the scale are labeled as text. Thus, we can replace these labels with numbers, and then convert the entire variable to numeric. table(ess_finland$lrscale) ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Left Right ## 25 62 148 183 599 199 296 217 79 24 59 ess_finland$lrscale[ess_finland$lrscale == &quot;Left&quot;] &lt;- 0 ess_finland$lrscale[ess_finland$lrscale == &quot;Right&quot;] &lt;- 10 ess_finland$lrscale &lt;- as.numeric(ess_finland$lrscale) Furthermore, Kestilä recoded polintr in such a way that there are only two categories. The lowest two and highest two categories were combined. Here is how to do this in R, so you can replicate their analysis: ess_finland$polintr_dummy &lt;- ifelse(ess_finland$polintr &lt;= 2, &quot;Not or hardly interested&quot;, &quot;Quite or very interested&quot;) Next, run a number of multiple linear regression analyses with the (sub-)scales of attitudes towards immigrants and political trust as subsequent dependent variables, and the same predictors as Kestilä. Inspect your output. Compare your results with the results from Kestilä. How do your results differ or agree with the results by Kestilä? fit_trust1 &lt;- lm(trustinstEFA ~ gndr + age + eduyrs + polintr_dummy + lrscale, data = ess_finland, na.action = na.omit) summary(fit_trust1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = trustinstEFA ~ gndr + age + eduyrs + polintr_dummy + ## lrscale, data = ess_finland, na.action = na.omit) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -3.6185 -0.4519 0.1278 0.5827 2.8276 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.
