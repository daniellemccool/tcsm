<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.1</span> Grading<a href="#grading" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>For each assignment, every element labeled with a lower case letter is graded fail (0 points), pass (1 point), or excellent (1.5 points).
Grades are summed for each assignment, and rescaled from 1-10.
The final grade is a weighted average across assignments of the rescaled grades (weights in %).
Note that the assignments are <strong>not</strong> intended to be full-blown papers!
You only get 200 words to justify your theoretical model, and 300 words to discuss the results.
The focus should be on your analysis; how it relates to theory (introduction), and what you have learned from it and how you might improve it (discussion).</p>
</div>
<div id="rules" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="0.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.2</span> Rules<a href="#rules" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>For all three graded assignments, you are allowed to use all course materials,
including the GitBook, and search engines</li>
<li>The first two assignments are made in groups.
<ul>
<li>For these assignments, it is not allowed to work together with other groups.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The final assignment is made individually.
<ul>
<li>For this assignment, it is not allowed to recruit outside help</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In all cases, you are obligated to hand in original work conducted by you or your group. Failure to do so constitutes fraud.</li>
<li>You also have a moral obligation to obey the rules. For this course, I have chosen a form of examination that allows you to showcase what you have learned flexibly. This spares you the stress of long exams (the two exams for this course used to be 4 hours each) and cramming all course material. It also assumes that you make the assignment in good faith, so I simply ask that you hold up your end of the bargain, and hand in your original work to show what you’ve learned.</li>
<li>The final assignment also helps you assess your ability to independently analyse data, which is important to know for your future courses and/or career.</li>
</ul>
<div id="academic-misconduct" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="0.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">0.2.1</span> Academic misconduct<a href="#academic-misconduct" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>You will be completing this assignment remotely, instead of making a test at the university under the supervision of lecturers. For most students this will make no difference, but of course remote assessment is more susceptible to fraud.
By handing in your final assignment, you therefore explicitly confirm that you have made this assignment by yourself and are submitting work you have written yourself, that you will be using your own login details, and that you have not had instrumental help in making the assignment.</p>
<p>All assignments are submitted via SafeAssign in Blackboard and are checked for plagiarism. If fraud or plagiarism is detected or suspected, the Board of Examiners will be informed in the usual manner, and in the event of fraud, the sanctions referred to in Article 5.14 of the Education and Examination Regulations (EER) will apply (download from <a href="https://students.uu.nl/files/fsw-ba-oer-engelstalig-2019-2020pdf" class="uri">https://students.uu.nl/files/fsw-ba-oer-engelstalig-2019-2020pdf</a>). Note that the sanctions may apply to the person committing fraud, to the person(s) making fraud possible, and to the test as a whole.<br />
Lecturers also have the option of administering additional oral tests if they have reasons to do so.
Thank you for your cooperation, we will only be able to get through this period together!</p>
