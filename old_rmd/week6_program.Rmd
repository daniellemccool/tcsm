How can I investigate mediation/moderation?

**Homework for the lecture on Moderation:**

In addition to mediation, researchers often have theories about moderation. Moderation implies that the effect of X on Y depends on another variable. For instance, the effect of feedback (X) on performance (Y) may depend on age (moderator), in that children who are older can more effectively process feedback than younger children.
