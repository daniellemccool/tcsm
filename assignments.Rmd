# Assignments {-}

This chapter contains the details and binding information about the three 
assignments that comprise the portfolio upon which your course grade is based.

- For each assignment, you will use R to analyze some real-world data, and you 
will write up your results in a concise report.
    - The required components of these analyses/reports are delineated in the 
    following three sections.
    - You will submit this report via Blackboard.
- You will complete the first two assignments in your [Assignment Group][group].
- You will complete the third assignment individually.
- The first two assignments each contribute 25% of your course grade.
- The third assignment contributes 50% of your course grade.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Assignment 1: Latent Variable Model {-}

In the first assignment, **you will work in groups** to apply a *latent variable 
model* to a real-world problem wherein the observed variables are indirect 
indicators of an unobserved social scientific construct. The components of the 
first assignment are described below.

1. Find a suitable dataset, and describe the data. **(150 words)**.
    a. Data you have collected yourself (e.g., for a previous course)
    a. Open data (e.g., data provided with a published paper)
    a. The “Coping with COVID-19” dataset (if you can’t find anything else)
1. State the research question, and define the theoretical latent variable 
model. **(150 words)**
    a. Be sure to clearly explicate all parts of your model.
1. Translate your theoretical latent variable model into `lavaan` syntax, and 
estimate the model.

### Submission {-}

Assignment 3 is due at 23:59 on Friday 11 November 2022

- Submit your report via the [Assignment 3][a3] portal on Blackboard.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Procedures {-}

---

### Formating {-}

- You must submit your assignment reports in PDF format.
- Each report should include a title page.
- The title page should include the following information:
    - The name of the assignment.
    - The names of all assignment authors (i.e., all group members for 
    Assignments 1 & 2, your name for Assignment 3).
    - The Assignment Group number (only for Assignments 1 & 2).

---

### Length {-}

In the preceding three sections, some line-items in the descriptions of the 
assignments concluded with a word count.

- These sections of your report must conform to the indicated word counts.
    - E.g., the *Data* section of Assignment 1 must contain no more that 150 
    words, and the *Discussion* section of Assignment 3 must contain no more 
    than 500 words.
- In all other sections, you may use as many words as necessary to adequately 
explain yourself (though concision and parsimony are still encouraged).

Note that the assignments are **not** intended to be full-blown papers! You only 
get a few hundred words to describe your data, justify your theoretical model, 
and discuss the results. The focus should be on the definition of your model, 
how this model relates to theory (introduction), and what you have learned from 
your estimated model (discussion).

---

### Submission {-}

You will submit your reports through Blackboard.

- Each assignment has a corresponding item in the "Assignments" section of the 
BB page through which you will submit your reports.
- For Assignments 1 & 2, you may only submit one report per group.
    - Designate one group member to submit the report.
    - The grade for this submission will apply to all group members.
- If something goes wrong with the submission, or you notice a mistake (before 
the deadline) that you want to correct, you may upload a new version of your 
report. 
    - We will grade the final submitted version.
- The submissions will be screened with SafeAssign.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Grading {-}

Each assignment comprises 6 components (i.e., the line-items labelled 1--6 in 
the assignment descriptions).

- Each of these 6 elements will be scored as:
    - Insufficient (0 points)
    - Sufficient (1 point)
    - Excellent (1.5 points)
    
The individual assignment grades will be computed as follows:

1. Sum the 6 component grades.
1. Add 1 to the sum of the component grades.

Consequently, we have the following landmarks:

- All components marked as *Insufficient* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 1
- All components marked as *Sufficient* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 7
- All components marked as *Excellent* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 10

The final course grade, $G_{course}$, will be computed as the weighted average of 
the three individual assignment grades, $G_{a1}$, $G_{a2}$, $G_{a3}$:

\[
G_{course} = 0.25 G_{a1} + 0.25 G_{a2} + 0.5 G_{a3}
\]

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Rules {-}

---

### Resources {-}

For all three assignments, you may use any reference materials you like, 
including:

- All course materials
- The course GitBook
- Additional books and papers
- The internet

---

### Collaboration {-}

You will complete the first two assignments in groups.

- Although you will work in groups, your group may not work together with other 
groups.

You will complete the final assignment individually. 

- For this assignment, you may not work with anyone else.

For all three assignments, you are obligated to submit original work (i.e., work 
conducted for this course by you or your group). 

- Submitting an assignment that violates this condition constitutes fraud.
- Such cases of fraud will be addressed according to the 
[University's standard policy](https://students.uu.nl/en/practical-information/policies-and-procedures/fraud-and-plagiarism).

---

### Academic integrity {-}

Hopefully, you also feel a moral obligation to obey the rules. For this course, 
we have implemented an examination that allows you to showcase what you have 
learned in a more realistic way than a written exam would allow. 

- This assessment format spares you the stress of long exams (the two exams for 
this course used to be 4 hours each) and the attendant studying/cramming. 
- The assignments will also help you assess your ability to independently 
analyse data, which is important to know for your future courses and/or career.

However, this format also assumes that you complete the assignments in good 
faith. So, I simply ask that you hold up your end of the bargain, and submit 
your original work to show us what you’ve learned.

---

### Strict stuff {-}

By submitting your assignments (both group and individual), you confirm the 
following:

1. You have completed the assignment yourself (or with your group)
1. You are submitting work that you have written yourself (or with your group)
1. You are using your own UU credentials to submit the assignment
1. You have not had outside help that violates the conditions delineated above 
while completing the assignment

All assignments will be submitted via SafeAssign in Blackboard and, thereby, 
checked for plagiarism. If fraud or plagiarism is detected or suspected, we will 
inform the Board of Examiners in the usual manner. In the event of demonstrable 
fraud, the sanctions delineated in Article 5.15 of the 
[Education and Examination Regulations (EER)](https://students.uu.nl/en/fss/education-and-examination-regulations-eer)
will apply.
