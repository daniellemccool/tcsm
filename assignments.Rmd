# Assignments {-}

This chapter contains the details and binding information about the three 
assignments that comprise the portfolio up which your course grade is based.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Assignment 1: Latent Variable Model {-}

In the first assignment, **you will work in groups** to apply a *latent variable 
model* to a real-world problem wherein the observed variables are indirect 
indicators of an unobserved social scientific construct. The details of the 
assignment are given below. 

1. Find a suitable dataset, and describe the data. **(150 words)**.
    a. Data you have collected yourself (e.g., for a previous course)
    a. Open data (e.g., data provided with a published paper)
    a. The “Coping with COVID-19” dataset (if you can’t find anything else)
1. State the research question, and define the theoretical latent variable 
model. **(150 words)**
    a. Be sure to clearly explicate all parts of your model.
1. Translate your theoretical latent variable model into `lavaan` syntax, and 
estimate the model.
    a. Provide relevant output in a suitable format.
1. Explain your rationale for important modeling decisions. **(300 words)**
    a. Motivate your choice of latent variable model (i.e., EFA, CFA, PCA).
    a. Discuss assumptions.
    a. Discuss other important decisions that could have influence your results.
1. Report and interpret the results in APA style.
    a. Include measures of model fit.
1. Discuss the results. **(300 words)**
    a. Use your results to answer the research question.
    a. Consider the strengths and limitations of your analysis.
     
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Assignment 2: Path Model {-}

For the second assignment, **you will work in groups** to apply a *path model* 
that describes how several variables could be causally related.

    a. Open data (e.g., data provided with a published paper)
    a. The “Coping with COVID-19” dataset (if you can’t find anything else)
1. State the research question, and introduce the theoretical SEM. 
**(200 words)**
    a. This model can be a re-analysis of a question that was originally tested 
    using regression or ANOVA in a published paper.
    a. The structural component of this model must include, at least, three
    variables.
    a. The model must include, at least, one latent variable.
1. Translate your theoretical SEM into `lavaan` syntax, and estimate the model.
    a. Provide relevant output in a suitable format.

    model and the regression or ANOVA results from the original paper.
    a. Discuss other important decisions that could have influence your results.
1. Report and interpret the results in APA style.
    a. Include measures of model fit.
    a. Include measures of explained variance for the dependent variables.
1. Discuss the results. **(500 words)**
    a. Use your results to answer the research question.
    a. Consider the strengths and limitations of your analysis.

## Procedure & Format

### File format

You must write your report as an R Markdown document.

---

### Report length

In the preceding three sections, some line-items in the descriptions of the 
assignments concluded with a word count.

- These sections of your report must conform to the indicated word counts.
    - E.g., the *Data* section of Assignment 1 must contain no more that 150 
    words, and the *Discussion* section of Assignment 3 must contain no more 
    than 500 words.
- In all other sections, you may use as many words as necessary to adequately 
explain yourself (though concision and parsimony are still encouraged).

Note that the assignments are **not** intended to be full-blown papers! You only 
get a few hundred words to describe your data, justify your theoretical model, 
and discuss the results. The focus should be on the definition of your model, 
how this model relates to theory (introduction), and what you have learned from 
your estimated model (discussion).

---

### Submission procedure

You will submit your reports through Blackboard.

- Each assignment has a corresponding item in the "Assignments" section of the 
course BB page through which you will submit your reports.
- The submissions will be screened with SafeAssign.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Grading

Each assignment comprises 6 components (i.e., the line-items labelled 1--6 in 
the assignment descriptions).

- Each of these 6 elements will be scored as:
    - Insufficient (0 points)
    - Sufficient (1 point)
    - Excellent (1.5 points)
    
The individual assignment grades will be computed as follows:

1. Sum the 6 component grades.
1. Add 1 to the sum of the component grades.

Consequently, we have th following landmarks:

- All components marked as *Insufficient* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 1
- All components marked as *Sufficient* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 7
- All components marked as *Excellent* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 10

The final course grade will be computed as the weighted average of the three 
individual assignment grades. Specifically:

\[
G_{course} = 0.25 G_{a1} + 0.25 G_{a2} + 0.5 G_{a3}
\]

Where $G$ indicates a grade and the subscripts have the obvious meaning.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Rules

For all three assignments, you may use any reference materials you like, 
including:

- All course materials
- The course GitBook
- Additional books and papers
- The internet

You will complete the first two assignments in groups.

- Although you will work in groups, you may not work together with other 
   groups.

You will complete the final assignment individually. 

- For this assignment, you may not work with anyone else.

For all three assignments, you are obligated to submit original work (i.e., work 
conducted by you or your group for this course). 

- Submitting an assignment that violates this condition constitutes fraud.
- Such cases of fraud will be addressed according to the 
[University's standard policy](https://students.uu.nl/en/practical-information/policies-and-procedures/fraud-and-plagiarism).

Hopefully, you also feel a moral obligation to obey the rules. For this course, 
we have implemented an examination that allows you to showcase what you have 
learned in a more realistic way than a written exam would allow. 

- This assessment format spares you the stress of long exams (the two exams for 
this course used to be 4 hours each) and the attendant studying/cramming. 
- The assignments will also help you assess your ability to independently 
analyse data, which is important to know for your future courses and/or career.

However, this format also assumes that you complete the assignments in good 
faith. So, I simply ask that you hold up your end of the bargain, and submit 
your original work to show what you’ve learned.

### Academic misconduct

The preceding points not withstanding, this section explicates the consequences 
of fraud more clearly.

By submitting your assignments (both group and individual), you confirm the 
following:

1. You have completed the assignment yourself (or with your group)
1. You are submitting work that you have written yourself (or with your group)
1. You are using your own UU credentials to submit the assignment
1. You have not had outside help that violates the conditions delineated above 
while completing the assignment

All assignments will be submitted via SafeAssign in Blackboard and, thereby, 
checked for plagiarism. If fraud or plagiarism is detected or suspected, the 
Board of Examiners will be informed in the usual manner. In the event of fraud, 
the sanctions deliniated in Article 5.14 of the 
[Education and Examination Regulations (EER)](https://students.uu.nl/en/fss/education-and-examination-regulations-eer).
