# Assignments {-}

This chapter contains the details and binding information about the three 
assignments that comprise the portfolio upon which your course grade is based.

- For each assignment, you will use R to analyze some real-world data, and you 
will write up your results in a concise report.
    - The required components of these analyses/reports are delineated in the 
    following three sections.
    - You will submit this report via Blackboard.
- You will complete the first two assignments in your [Assignment Group][group].
- You will complete the third assignment individually.
- The first two assignments each contribute 25% of your course grade.
- The third assignment contributes 50% of your course grade.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Submission {-}

Assignment 3 is due at 23:59 on Friday 11 November 2022

- Submit your report via the [Assignment 3][a3] portal on Blackboard.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Data {-}

If you have your own data, that's great, and we strongly encourage you to use
those data for the projects. That being said, most students will not have their
own data. If you're one of the majority without data, you'll have to find an 
existing dataset to analyze (in case you were wondering, you won't have time to 
collect new data).

---

### Sources {-}

Those who need data can make use of one of the myriad publicly available 
datasets available online. Of course these datasets will vary widely in terms of 
their applicability to the project and the amount of work required to prepare 
the variables for analysis. 

The following links point to various sources of publicly available data.

- [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [GSS Sata Explorer](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/) 
- [StatLine Open Data](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/our-services/open-data/)
- [Open Data from the Dutch Government](https://data.overheid.nl/)
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/browse?filter=solution-type:dataset&_ga=2.82807711.826450092.1580463730-1425634986.1574932949)
- [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) 

---

### Tips {-}

When searching for a suitable dataset, consider the following tips:

- It will take longer than you expect.
    - Start searching for data early.
    - Plan on devoting a good chunk of time to tracking down a useful dataset.
    - Realize that even after you find the data, you will also have to do a good 
    bit of cleaning to get the variables ready for analysis.
- Expect to be disappointed. 
    - You may find a dataset that looks good on paper but won't work for the 
    project (e.g., too much missing data, poor coverage for key relations, jenky 
    distributions, etc.).
        - You usually won't discover these issue until you've already downloaded 
        the data and started exploring/cleaning.
        - Make sure you check the actual data you've downloaded before you 
        declare success in your search.
- Keep the project requirements in mind when searching for data. 
    - You will need, at least, three interesting variables to model in some sort 
    of causal process (required for Assignment 3).
    - You will need, at least, one latent variable (required for Assignments 1 & 3).
        - To define a latent variable, you need multiple items (at least three) 
        measuring the same hypothetical construct.
        - In practice, these multiple indicators usually come from scales (e.g., 
        NEO-PI Big Five Personality Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory).
- If you find a dataset that looks suitable, but you want to confirm, send 
me ([Kyle](mailto:k.m.lang@uu.nl)) a link to the dataset, and I'll let you know 
if it will work for the assignments.
        
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Procedures {-}

---

### Formating {-}

- You must submit your assignment reports in PDF format.
- Each report should include a title page.
- The title page should include the following information:
    - The name of the assignment.
    - The names of all assignment authors (i.e., all group members for 
    Assignments 1 & 2, your name for Assignment 3).
    - The Assignment Group number (only for Assignments 1 & 2).
- You must include the code used to define and run your model(s) as an appendix.
    - Try to format the text in this appendix clearly.
    - Use a monospace font.
    
---

### Length {-}

In the preceding three sections, some line-items in the descriptions of the 
assignments concluded with a word count.

- These sections of your report must conform to the indicated word counts.
    - E.g., the *Data* section of Assignment 1 must contain no more that 150 
    words, and the *Discussion* section of Assignment 3 must contain no more 
    than 500 words.
- Include the word counts for these sections as part of the section heading 
(e.g., in parentheses following the section title).
    - You only need to include word counts for the sections for which a word 
    count is indicated above.
- In all other sections, you may use as many words as necessary to adequately 
explain yourself (though concision and parsimony are still encouraged).

Note that the assignments are **not** intended to be full-blown papers! You only 
get a few hundred words to describe your data, justify your theoretical model, 
and discuss the results. The focus should be on the definition of your model, 
how this model relates to theory (introduction), and what you have learned from 
your estimated model (discussion).

---

### Submission {-}

You will submit your reports through Blackboard.

- Each assignment has a corresponding item in the "Assignments" section of the 
BB page through which you will submit your reports.
- For Assignments 1 & 2, you may only submit one report per group.
    - Designate one group member to submit the report.
    - The grade for this submission will apply to all group members.
- If something goes wrong with the submission, or you notice a mistake (before 
the deadline) that you want to correct, you may upload a new version of your 
report. 
    - We will grade the final submitted version.
- The submissions will be screened with SafeAssign.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Grading {-}

Each assignment comprises 6 components (i.e., the line-items labelled 1--6 in 
the assignment descriptions).

- Each of these 6 elements will be scored as:
    - Insufficient (0 points)
    - Sufficient (1 point)
    - Excellent (1.5 points)
- The grader may also choose to assign partial points for some sections.
- There is also one point awarded for satisfying the formatting and submission 
requirements.

The individual assignment grades will be computed as follows:

1. Sum the 6 component grades.
1. Add the formatting/submission score to the sum of the component grades.

So, given a full point for formatting/submission, we have the following landmarks:

- All components marked as *Insufficient* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 1
- All components marked as *Sufficient* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 7
- All components marked as *Excellent* $\rightarrow$ Assignment Grade = 10

The final course grade, $G_{course}$, will be computed as the weighted average of 
the three individual assignment grades, $G_{a1}$, $G_{a2}$, $G_{a3}$:

\[
G_{course} = 0.25 G_{a1} + 0.25 G_{a2} + 0.5 G_{a3}
\]

### Example Assignment {-}

You can find an example of a good submission (for Assignment 1) [here](data/a1_example.pdf).

This example is not perfect (no paper ever is), and several points could be 
improved. That being said, this submission exemplifies what we're looking for 
in your project reports. So, following the spirit of this example would earn you
a high grade.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Rules {-}

---

### Resources {-}

For all three assignments, you may use any reference materials you like, 
including:

- All course materials
- The course GitBook
- Additional books and papers
- The internet

---

### Collaboration {-}

You will complete the first two assignments in groups.

- Although you will work in groups, your group may not work together with other 
groups.

You will complete the final assignment individually. 

- For this assignment, you may not work with anyone else.

For all three assignments, you are obligated to submit original work (i.e., work 
conducted for this course by you or your group). 

- Submitting an assignment that violates this condition constitutes fraud.
- Such cases of fraud will be addressed according to the 
[University's standard policy](https://students.uu.nl/en/practical-information/policies-and-procedures/fraud-and-plagiarism).

---

### Academic integrity {-}

Hopefully, you also feel a moral obligation to obey the rules. For this course, 
we have implemented an examination that allows you to showcase what you have 
learned in a more realistic way than a written exam would allow. 

- This assessment format spares you the stress of long exams (the two exams for 
this course used to be 4 hours each) and the attendant studying/cramming. 
- The assignments will also help you assess your ability to independently 
analyse data, which is important to know for your future courses and/or career.

However, this format also assumes that you complete the assignments in good 
faith. So, I simply ask that you hold up your end of the bargain, and submit 
your original work to show us what you’ve learned.

---

### Strict stuff {-}

By submitting your assignments (both group and individual), you confirm the 
following:

1. You have completed the assignment yourself (or with your group)
1. You are submitting work that you have written yourself (or with your group)
1. You are using your own UU credentials to submit the assignment
1. You have not had outside help that violates the conditions delineated above 
while completing the assignment

All assignments will be submitted via SafeAssign in Blackboard and, thereby, 
checked for plagiarism. If fraud or plagiarism is detected or suspected, we will 
inform the Board of Examiners in the usual manner. In the event of demonstrable 
fraud, the sanctions delineated in Article 5.15 of the 
[Education and Examination Regulations (EER)](https://students.uu.nl/en/fss/education-and-examination-regulations-eer)
will apply.
